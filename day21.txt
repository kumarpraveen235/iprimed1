it is   brower/platform indepenedent
used to generate dynamic web pages
it is  LOOSLEY typed  language
supports  loose coupling
supports   validation events  listeners  date math  regular expression   string  functions
timing functions  
supports DOM BOM
js is executed by js engine  in  browser
it is  inetrepreted language  
js statements  are interpreted  by browser
