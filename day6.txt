final   keyword

it is allpied to varaibles   methods    classes    parameters
un initilaized  variables




final to variables

when  u apply final  to varaibles
   value  of  such variables   cannot be  changed

they   kept constant through out the  program


when  u apply final  to methods  such methods cannot be overridden
but final methods can be inheritted



final is also applied to the class
such classes cannot be sub classed  or u cannot  extend  such classes   by  sub class

such classes  executes  fast

used to creates   IMMUTABLE  CLASSES
(cannot be  changed)

final  is also  used to method/ constructor parameters

where it's value cannot be changed


when u apply   final to uninitilaized   variables   such variables are called
blank final  varaibles   and these are  initiliazed  in init block
or constructors



abstraction:
it is an  object  oriented   concept  in which     only   functionalities
can be  shown and  implementation  details are hidden
abstract   class
when u create a  class with abstract  key word  it is called abstract class
abstract  class  contains   methods   with out body(abstract  methods)
and  methods  with body (concrete  methods)
absatract method

any method   defined  with out implementation  that  method is called abstract method

these   must   start  with  abstract keyword   and with  ;
with  EMPTY body
syntax
public    abstract  void m();
public   abstract  int   find(int a);
public   abstract  class     abc
{
    public    abstract  void m();// abstract method
    void  mm()    //  concrete method
   {
      System.out.println("hi");
}
}
     

abstract class  features
1)  abstract class  contains   instance  varaibles,  constants,   constructors
abstract methods   concrete methods  main methods.  So u cannot achieve 100% abstraction
2) since  abstract class contains  both  concrete and  abstract  methods  u  cannot
create  OBJECT  for   such classes
3) if  any class  contains  alleast  one  abstract method then that  class can
be declared as  abstract  class
4) it is not mandatory that  abstract  class  must contain alleast one abstract  method
5)abstract  class must  be extended   from  sub class. That is  why this  class is class
is called  sub classers  responsibility
6)   if  sub class  extends   abstract class  then  sub  class must  override the  method
of   abstract class  or that   class must be declared  as  abstract
6) abstract class can contain  static/final  concrete method
7) abstract mathods  cannot declared as static /   final
8) abstract  class  can also  achieve  upcasting but  does not support
multiple inheritance at class level
9) abstract class used show the impelmentaion for  interface  methods
  

interfaces
interfaces   are  used  to achieve  100% abstraction
used to achieve  multiple  inheritance

used to  achieve  loose coupling
interfaces are   always  impemented  by classes  /   extended  by interfaces
interfaces  lack instance varaibles and  concrete  methods
interfaces   achieve  inheritance  by extends  & implements keyword
interfaces   not allows  contructors and  methods and blocks


syntax


public  interface   inter1
{
    int  i=19;
    void m();
}


PT  abstract  classee are   used to show the  impelmenation for   interface  methods


when  above  interface  is compiled


   compiler adds  public static  final   keyword   behind i
   and   adds   public  abstract  keyword   behind  m()


syntax

public  interface  inter1
{
     void  m();
     datatype  varname=value;
}

how    interface   supports   multiple  inheritance?
1 interface  can extend   1  or more interface
1 class  implement 1 or more interface

class cannot  extend   interface
class cannot  implement class
interface  cannot  extend class
interface cannot imeplement interface
like  abstract  class  any class   implements   the  interface  that  class  must
override the methods of interface other  wise u will  get compile  time error
u cannot achieve  multiple inheritance at class  level as you will get ambiguity
class A
{
    void m()
{
     System.out.println("i am A's m()");
     }
}

class B  
{
    void m()
{
     System.out.println("i am B's m()");
     }
}
class C  extends  A,B 
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
{
         C cc=new C();
       cc.m();//   which class m() method  called?
}
}


wap to illustrate multiple  inheritance  throuh extends  key word
using interfaces



different types  of interfaces
1)   bulit in interface
eg :  Set  Map  List  e.t.c
2)  user defined intreface
when we create  interface  using  interface  keyword

3)  functional interface
contains  only  one abstract method and  more  than  1   default  concrete method
created by using  @FunctionalInterface annotation  it is  1.8 feature
lamda  expression and   method  referemces   uses  functional  interfaces  for
the   method  implementation
Eg  Runnable  Comparator  RowMapper
4) marker  interface
this  interface  does not contains  any body or  varaiable
it contains  EMPTY implementations  Supplies Run  time info to JVM at run time
Eg  Clonaeble, Serializable Remote   Repository   e.t.c


Nested  Interfaces

if one interface  is nested  within another  interface  it is called  nested  interface
used to access the  members  of  outer  interface
since  all  interfaces  are   specified at  same  place u can easily maintain the  code
improves code  reusability, code optimization, code maintainability   e.t.c

u can nest  
interface  within interface
class  within interface
interface  within class

anonymous   objects and  anonymous inner classes

any  object   which  is created   with  out any name  it is  called  anonymous  object
such  objects  are automatically  eligible   for  garbage collection
when  u finished invoking any  method /   accessed  any variable

 
anonymous inner classes
like  anonymous  objects   anonymous inner classes  also   don't  have  any name

if the class  is created with out any name  it is called anonymous inner classes
for  such  classes  compiler  assigns  name to it in  the  background
these   classes reduces the  generation  of  dot class files
used  lot in   awt  packages, multithreading  

syntax

  classname  refvariable=new classname()
{
      body
};       anonymous inner class body closes

to create   an anonymous inner classes   there  must  be  class  hierachy (IS-A relationship)

create  a  abstract class  with  one  abstract  method and  show 
it's  implementation through anonymous  inner class

packages and   access specifiers

 packages

package is a  collection of  classes  and interfaces sub classes

partitioning of class  name  spaces into  managable  chunks  are called  packages
it is  a container  for  classes and    interfaces


2 types  of  packages

1) built in pkg   Eg: java.util java.io   java.net   java.applet   java.awt  java.lang
java.sql  e.t.c


2)   user  defined pkg
when  we create  our own pkg it is  called   user defined pkg

to create   user defined pkg

package praveen;
it is  must be  TOP statement i program


package name
    |
import  statement
    |
class name   


how to execute pkg program  from command prompt?

javac   -d  .      filename.java

java pkgname.filename



-d  :   tells  where to generate  class file?

.  : specifies current  directory


how   to access  from  one  pkg program  to another  pkg program?


1)   by importing    whole  package using * (imports  all   ineterfaces/classes  except  sub pkg)
2)  by imoorting    pkg with class/interface  name

3) with out import (using FULLY QUALIFIED CLASS / INTERFACE name)


when u defined   packages   within packages  it is called   sub packages

syntax    pkgname1.pkgname2.pkgname3......


wap  to  create   following    2    classes

java.lang pkg  classes


String  StringBuffer StringBuilder Excception Thread  Wrapper classes

this   package is imported  by default in the  program

String class

String   m(char  s, char y)  //error
{
    return  s+y;    //   adds    ascii  letters
}

as String is  a class  
char  is  primitive type


String is   sequence  of IMMUTABLE  characters

immutable  means  cannot be  changed  /  modified / not altered


class   a extends  String 
{}
above    code  will give  error  as   String is  IMMUTABLE  class
internally  it is  final  class. It cannot be sub classed



Implicitely  String class  impelemnts    
java.io.Serializable, Comparable<String>, CharSequence  interfaces
