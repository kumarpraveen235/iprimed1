static   to a instance variable

syntax  
public static  int a=100;


when  u apply static  to a  instance  variable   they  will be stored in class area
these  varaibles  get  the  values at the class loading time
static varaibles  shared  among multiple  objects
they  represents the  common properties of the Object like
emps of same company  students of same college
used for memory  utilization
these varaible  cannot be used in  costructors  for  initilaization
u can modify static variables
cannot  be used with this  keyword

write   program  to implement  copy  constructor  in java
used to copy the  values of one obj to other  object

write  a program  to prove  that this  key word is  used  to  refers a current
class instance  varaible

create  a class called  Student with  id, name  subject and  marks
Create  array   3  students and  enter  above info and display
use   constructors   and methods

static   to methods


static  key word is also  applied to methods
when u apply static  key word to methods  such  methods  can be  invoked
with  out creating an object
Eg main  method  
static  methods  must access  only static  variables
u can also  invoke  static  method  directly  by the name of class

syntax

public  static  void m()
{}
public static  int m1()
{
    return 10;
}


class  A
{
    int  s=100;
  public static void main(String[] args) {
	   
	   System.out.println(s);
}
}


static   variables  to blocks

block is a  another  place  where  u can perform   operation  (business logic)
along with methods and constructors
syntax

static {
code;
}



it is  similiar  to static  methods  only

it executes   before  main method
up to jdk 1.6 u can  execute java  program with static  block without  main method


u cannot define any methods / constructors in static  blocks 
u can declare  variable  but  u cannot declare  static variables

it gets memory @ class loading time
like static method  static  block  must also  access   only static   instance  variables



if i declared  static  variables   but not initialized then  it is  called

blank static   variables
blank static  variables are initialized in  static  blocks

static   key word is also  applied to nested   classes


NESTED CLASSES

When  a  class is defined   within another  class
it is  called   nested  classes
Syntax

class    A
{
     int data=100;
    
 class  B
{
      int  a=100;
     void m()
{}
}
}


in the  above eg   A is called  outer class (TOP level class)

B is  called  nested  / inner classs


class B can  have   public/private/protected/default/abstract/static/final

access  specifiers


But A is a  TOP level class  must have  only
public/default/abstract/final access specifier


advantages  of nested classess

1)  since  all  classes are  specified at same location  u can easily maintain the 
code
2)  improves the  CODE  optimization  code  readabiliy, re usability
3) nested classes can also access  all members  of   outer classes
including private




types of nested  classes

1) non static  nested classes
if the  nested class is  defined inside   outer class  with out static  key
word it is called   non static   nested class   
These are also  called  inner classes

class    A
{
     int data=100;
    
 class  B
{
      int  a=100;
     void m()
{}
}
}
3  types

1)  member  inner class
if the  nested class is  defined inside   outer class  but  out  side the  method
is called  member inner class
It can  be invoked within a  class / out of the  class


2)   local innner  class

if the  nested class is  defined inside   outer class & also in side the  method
is called  local inner class
Rules
1) local inner class  must   be  instantiated   within the  method
2) local inner  class must be  default  / final 
3)  local  inner class  must access  only final / default  local  variable






3) anonymous inner class







2) static   nested classes

if the  nested class is  defined inside   outer class  with  static  key
word it is called   static   nested class   
these   must  access   only the  static  members  of outer class  including
private

static   nested  classes  can also have  private  public  default protected




INHERITANCE


if  one   class / object   aquires  properties or  behaviour   of another or parent class
/object it is called  INHERITANCE
it is  IS-A relationship  
used  to create   new classes  with   existing  class properties
a class   which   got inheritted  is called  super/base/parent  class
a   class   which does inhertting is called sub class/  child class
Syntax
class  Emp
{   int  sal; String name;
}
class  Manager   extends   Emp
{
      int bocus;
}

here  Manager  is called sub class
Emp is called  super class

u can   achive  inheritance in java   by 2  keywords  extends &implements

in java   at the  class level   MULTIPLE  INHERITANCE is not
possible  because of ambiguity


types  of  inheritance
1)  single  inheritance  

1 class  extends  1 class

class A{}
class B extends  A{}


2)   Hierarchical  inheritance

in this  more than  1  sub class  extends   same  parent class

class A{}
class B extends  A{}
class C extends  A{}

3)   Multi level  inheritance

in this    sub classes  extends  parent  class  in   chaining  of inheritance

class A{}
class B extends  A{}
class C extends  B{}

4)  Multiple  inheritance

it   is  not supported at  class level
supported at  interface  level

like  one interface can extend  2 / more  interfaces

one  class  can implement  2/ more   interfaces


interface  A{}  
interface  B{}
interface  c  extends A, B
{}

or

interface  A{}  
interface  B{}
class  c  implements A, B
{}



method overriding?
in a  class  hierarchy (IS - A relation ship) when   sub class  method   has   same  name 
and   same  type  signature(return type & parameters)as  that of  super class method
then we say that  sub  class method  has overridden   super class  method

need
to provide a  saperate  implemenattion  for   sub class method  which is already
defined  by super class ,
  we need  method overriding

it is  also  called  as  run time polymorphism

JAVA  annotations


annotations  are  introduced  in jdk 1.5
these  provides  run time  info to JVM at  run time
these  are  applied at  class  method  interface variable &  constructor level
2  types
built in  
these  are present in  java.lang.* pkg
eg: 
@Override  @SupressWarning  @Deprecated

@Override
it is a method level annotation forces  DEVELOPER  to compulsorily
override the method



static   methods   cannot be overridden
as  these methods  are invoked with out creating objects
u can   invoke  these  methods  through the class name


access  specifiers   in the  method overriding

access  specifiers  from  most restricted to widest  scope

private  default protected  public 


rule  
in method  overriding accessspecifier  of the  sub class  overridden method

must have a  WIDEST SCOPE  compared to the accessspecifier  of the  sub class   method
else  u will  get compile  tie error







custom   when u create  our own annotations   we call it as custom annotations

List out  differences   between  method overloading and  overriding



Run time  polymorphism  /  up  casting


call   to overridden method   is resolved at run time  rather  than  compile  time
is called   upcasting or  run time  polymorphism
in this   super class reference  variable  refers to sub class object ,  based
on this   this  referece  variable  which  refers to which version of  overridden  method,

that  version version  of  overridden method  executes.  This  is  decided at  run time

Note  To achieve  up casting  there  must be  method overriding


upcasting is   possible  only for  overrodden method
it will not work for    data members/ instance  variables


use: to reduce   burden of   sub class   we use  upcasting


down casting

in this   sub class  reference  variable  refers to super  class  object
but  you  will get   compile  time  error

if   u  type  cast with  sub class  u will get   ClassCastException as  super
class has  less memory compared to suB class

Then  to achive  down casting  first

achive  upcasting then  do down casting

NOTE:WITH OUT  UPCASTING U CANNOT ACHIEVE  DOWN CASTING



super   key word

it is used  in  3  forms
1)  used to refer  a   super class  instance  varaible

syntax   super.instnacevarname;
2)  used  to invoke a   super class method
super.methodname()
3) used  to refer a  super class constructor

super()   super(a); super(a,b);    


Note: Like  this  key word  super is also  not used in static  context


when u use   super  key word to invoke  super class  constructor
following rules  must  be  applied
1)  call  to  super  must be always  1st statement  in the sub class  constructor
2)   when  u are using  super keyword  to invoke super class   constructor
compiler  implicitely  supplies   super()  key word as A first statement in
sub class constructor

create  2 classes  

class  A
Contains   2  no

class  B extends   A
contains   1  no

Init block  
instance  initilaizer block
it is usd to  initialize the  instance  variables
it  runs  each  time  when the  object  of the class is created

Initilaization of  instance  varaibles   can be  done directly  but
there  can be performed some extra operations  while initilializing  the   instance  
variables  in the  init block

syntax

{    initilaization logic }   // init block




init   block  will   always  executes   after   constructor

means   if u have an inheritance  then  


1st   super class   constructor executes  then  init  block executes
then  sub  class  constructor executes

if    if u  don't have an inheritance  then  


1st   init block executes then   constructor executes






1) w.a. p  to calculate the  net salary  of  employee
by reading   id, name , designation and  basic salary
net sal=bs+da(150%bs)+hra(30%bs)-tax(2%bs)
use  inheritance

2)prove that  init  block is always  exeuted  after constructor
