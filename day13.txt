java.io.* pkg
used  to perform read and write  operations
in java   2 kinds  of data  are there
1) stream data  represented in  0's & 1's
it is  handeled by InputStream and OutputStream  classes
2) Character data
handeled by Reader & Writer  classes

what is Stream?
it is  continuous  flow  of a data


InputStream  class

it is  a  super class  of   InputStream   used to read   a data
in this  data is read  from  sources like  Socket  File Array e.t.c


OutputStream  class

it is  a  super class  of   OutputStream   used to write   a data
in this  data is written to  destination like  Socket  File Array e.t.c

methods  of OutputStream class

void   flush() thorows IOException
void    write(byte[]   b) throws IOException
void   close()  throws IOException


methods  of InputStream class

int read() throws IOException
int available() throws IOException
void  skip(long c) throws IOException
void   close()  throws IOException



java.io.*   pkg also  provide a  File  class used  to create  a File

Constructor
File(String s)

methods
boolean  createNewFile() throws IOException
boolean  delete() 
boolean  isNew()
boolean isDirectory()
boolean  isFile()
String  getAbsolutePath()
String getCanonicalPath()


FileOutputStream

used to write  information to  destination


constructor
FileOutputStream(String s) throws IOException
FileOutputStream(String  s,  boolean append) throws IOException



BufferedOutputStream class

Contstructor

BufferedOutputStream(OutputStream os,  int bufsize)
USED to write a   info to  file  through buffer
it reduces  the   performing of   write  operation   again & again
whole  data  is stored in a buffer and  at time  once whole  data is wriiten  to file
from  buffer  by reducing no of write operations
it is  fast
in this  technique  it is mandatory to call flush() method


reading  a data  from  2  or  more than  2  files


SequenceInputStream


constructor

SequenceInputStream(InputStream is1, InputStream  is2)
reads   data from   2 files


SequenceInputStream(Enumeration e)
reads   data from more than  2 files

ByteArrayInputStream

it is  a class  used  to read  a  selected characters
mean  it treats   byte array  as a  source


Constructor

ByteArrayInputStream(byte[] b,   int  offset,  int length)

PrintStream
used  to  write   all  kinds  of  data  to the   file/ console

cosntructor
PrintStream(OutputStream  os, boolean  flushonnew line)
methods

void println(String |  char[]| byte | long| double s)




Writing a  state  of  an Object  in to byte Stream  is called
Serialization

To achive the  serialialization   our class  must implement   marker interface
called  Serializable.
Serializatio  is  used  in networking applications for  security

u can transffer the  serilialized object  on network and in   another JVM
u desrialize that object and  process it


ObjectOutputStream  class is  used for  Serializetion
Constructor
ObjectOutputStream(OutputStream os)
methods
void writeObject(Object  o)
serializes the object

process  of   bringing  the   Object  back to it's  original state  from serialized state is
called  Deserialization



ObjectInputStream  class is  used for  DeSerializetion
Constructor
ObjectInputStream(InputStream is)
methods
Object readObject()
Deserializes the object


Rules
datamembers  with  transient and  static modifiers  CANNOT be  serialized
in case  these are   serialized  later  if they  deserialized  u will get null

if u  serialize a Collection/ Array u must seriaize  the all  objects  of that Array
/Collection. If any one Object is  not serilaized then Serilization fails

In inheritance  if  super class implements  Serializable  interface
then  if sub class extends  super class  and if u want to serialize the Object of
Sub class  it  is not mandatory that  sub class  must also  implement  serializable interface

create  a class called  Student with id name and age

Create  one object &  serialize it and  de serialize it



CharcterData

to handle  character data   Sunmicrosystem   suggested  to use  Reader and Writer  classes
These  hadles  both  Character and  Byte  data
Used  prefferebly for  Character  data


2  Super  classes are  used

Writer  and  Reader


methods  of Writer class

void   flush() thorows IOException
void    write(char[]   b) throws IOException
void    write(String  b) throws IOException
void    write(int   b) throws IOException
void   close()  throws IOException

Writer  class is  implemented  in such a manner that  when u write data to  file
it is  mandatory that  u must call  flush() method


methods  of Reader class

int read() throws IOException
int available() throws IOException

void   close()  throws IOException


different Writer class
FileWriter
CharArrayWriter

BufferedWriter
PipedWriter
PrintWriter


different Reader class
FileReader
CharArrayReader
BufferedReader
PipedReader


using Reader and Writer  write to a File  and  Read it


CharArrayWriter
used to write  to more than 1 file
Constructor
CharArrayWriter()
method
void writeTo(Writer r)


PipedWriter and  PipedReader

these  used  to perform  read and  write  operations  symultaniously

constructor
PipedReader()
method


PipedWriter()
PipedWriter(Reader  r)


write  5  nos  using THread  on PipedWriter & through  PipedReader
read   5  nos and  Display


PrintWriter  class

used to write  any kind  of data   to file  or console

Constructor
PrintWriter(Writer w, boolean  flushonnewline)

no need to call  flush method

write  a  program to read a  data  from  key board  using  BufferedReader

Constructor
BufferedReader(InputStreamReader is)

reads  the  characters
method
String  readLine()


InputStreamReader(InputStream is)
reads  the  byte from  i/p stream and  converts  to  character


RandomAccessFile  clas

it allows  data  to be read and  written   to any  location   in the  file
it also  used to create a  file   along with  reading and writing

RandomAccess means   access to stored data   in any order
that user desires
For this  purpose it uses  one pointer

it is uses  a special  pointer called File Poiner
which indicates  current  position in the file
Read and  Write  operations     takes the place at the  location of the Pointer

Pointer  can be moved using seek() method


Constructor
RandomaccessFile(String  filename, String mode)

mode  can  "r"  => read  mode
     "rw"=> read write mode
   "rws"=>   read write+ change    to the  file's data  immediately  written to physical device


methods
void close() throws IOException
long getFilePointer();
int read()
int read(byte[] b)
int read(byte[] , int offset, int length)
byte readByte()
void seek(long pos)
void write(byte[] b)
void writeBytes(String s)



JDK   1.8  features

functional  interface
lamda expressions
method refernces
Stream API



Functional  interface
it contains  only  1   abstract  method and  many default concrete  method
Built  in  functional interfaces are
Comparator   Runnable  RowMapper(spring jdbc)  e.t.c

how to create   Functional interface?

we must use  @FunctionalInterface annotation at the Interface  level

u can  provide  implemenations for  For functional  interface  in 4 ways
1) normal class
2) anonymous inner class
3) lamda expression
4) method references

also  there are 43+ bulit  in  Finctional interfaces are also  there
which are  catogorozed  in 4
1) Connsumer 2) Supplier   3) Prdicate  4) Function


what are  lamda expressions?
it represents the  instance  of the  functional  interface
A lamda  expression  is an anonymous block of code that encapsulates an expression
or a block of statements  and returns a result
Syntax
(argumentlist)->implementation

the  arrow operator -> is used to saperate the list of parameters  and body
of the lamda expression
These are basically allows for creation and use of single method  anonymous classes
instead  of creating  saperate concrete class for  functional  interface
implemenation
These  can accept  0 or more parameters any of which can be passed  with or without type
specification  since type is  automatically  derived from the context
if there  are no parameters / no  arguments  tehn empty set of parenthesis
can be used .   No parenthses is required for single  argument
()->implemetaion
(i,i1)->imple


Assignments
1)   write a File  program to  read  the   contents  of 3 files   and  display
2)  create  a  class called  Book with id name author and price
create   4 objects  of book and  Store  inside the  ArrayList  And 
Serialize and  Desirialize the  List

3) create  a  super class   Emp  with  name and  salary
Create a  Subclass Manager  which  extends   Superclass Emp  with   bonus
Create  1 object  for   Manager  and  Serialize & deserialize sub class  

4) create one thread MyThread1  class   which finds  prime numbers below  10 and write in pipe
create  another Thread MyThread2  in which finds  febonesscci no below 10
and write in anoother pipe. In the main class using   pipe  compare  the elements which are
common to both prime and Fibonesscci. Display common elements

prime 1 2 3 5 7 
febonessi 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 

o/p 1 2 3  5
