How to create  a  Maven project

2 ways
1)using  command  prompt(u need to install maven)

2) using   eclipse  plugin(no need to install maven here)

2  types   of  projects  are  created
1) core  java project using  quick start  plugin
2) web app project using webapp plugin  
(note: to create  a  project  ur   computer must conencted to internet
as maven downloads all the  plugins  depenedecies  required  to deploy the project
from  it's central  repository called 
 https://mvnrepository.com/

after downloading it creates local  repository  called .m2 in home dir of ur computer

Life  Cycle of Maven
build   life cycle  is  a  well defined sequece of phases which defines the order in which the  goals
are to be executed
following are the phases

prepare resources   creating  /writing programs  createing  project   
validate   specifying depenedencies/ plugin with  groupid artifactid  versions
compile   generating class  file
test     executing test cases
package   generating  jar war files
install   installing jars war
deploy   deploying jar/war

Maven goals
A goal  represents  a   specific task  which contributes to a building or managing of a project
it may be bound to a 0 or more build phases like  compiling  installing pkging e.t.c
Syntax

mvn [plugin-name]:[goal-name]



following are the  goals
clean   cleans the  target folder
install  installs the  jar  / war  files  in target  folder
package  generates the  jar/war file
compile  generates the class file


plug in maven
it is   generally provides a  set of goals which can be executed   using follwing task

mvn [plugin-name]:[goal-name]

mvn compiler:compile


compiles the  source code

different plugins 

build plgins : used to build the  project

reporting plugin   usedto generate the  report

clean      cleans the  target folder
compiler   compile the source code
surefire      runs JUNIT test cases   creates  test reports
jar         builds the  jar  files
war      builds the  war filejavadoc    generate javadoc


write a  program  to display   helloworld  and generate class file& jar file

in a  goal    text  box   clean compile  install


s/w  testing
it is   a  method  to check  wether the  actual  s/w  product matches the  expected  
requirements and to ensure that s/w product is defect free
It involves  the  execution  of  s/w  componenents  using  manual /automated tools  to evaluate 
1 or more  properties of  interest
The purpose of s/w testing  is to identify errors gaps  or missing requirements in contracst to
a actual requirements

types  of testing
functional testing

evaluating the functionalilties of the  application
eg:  unit   testing    integration testing
 e.t.c
non functional  testing
it is also  called  performance testing
it relates to the performance of the application
Eg:   load testing performance testing  scalability  testing



UNit  testing
it involves the testing of each unit/module of the application
it helps the  developers to know  wether the individual  unit of code
working properly or not

in java  we  use   junit  4  & junit   5

2  ways  of testing

manual  testing
in this   test  cases are  executed  manually  by  the    testers
these are  performed  without using any s/w  tools
results of  such testing are not reliable / not 100% accurate
lot of human resources are  required to conduct the manual  testing as 
test cases are excuted manually by  users with out using any s/w tools
these are time consuming
to achieve this  testing it  is not mandatory to  have  a  programming knowledge
as these are  non programmable



automation  testing
in this   test  cases are  executed  by  the    testers  using the  s/w tool
these are  performed  by using using any s/w  tools like  JUNIT  SELENIUM  TEST NG
results of  such testing are MORE reliable / 100% accurate
Less no of human resources are  required to conduct the automation  testing as 
test cases are executed  by  users  with using  s/w tools
these are less time consuming  execute fast
to achieve this  testing it  is  mandatory to  have  a sound  programming knowledge
as these are   programmable

  
Introduction to JUNIT  4
Is is a  framework
it is  invented  by  a  organization   which conducts the   unit testing of
various technologies  called unit

Features 
1) supports  annotations
2) supports  TestRunner to get the  result of test case
3) supports  TestSuites  to integrate  more than 1 test case
4) supports Assert class to write the TestCase logic
5) supports  ExceptionHandling, Time Testing and  Parameterized testing
6) provides the  test o/p  in the form  of progress bar
maroon  for  test failure  parrot green for  test  success
 down load  2 jars

1)  hamcrest  core  1.3
2) unit 4.12

in the   maven project  test cases are wriiten  in  src/test/java folder
java  programs  are  written  in  src/main/java  folder

JUNIT  4 provides   following classes

1)Assert class

it is  present in org.junit.* & it is also present  in  junit.framework.* 

but i am  using org.junit.* pkg class
methods

public static  void  assertArrayEquals(Object[] c1, Object[]  c2)
public static  void  assertEquals(Object c1, Object  c2)
public static  void  assertSame(Object c1, Object c2)
public static  void  assertNotSame(Object c1, Object c2)
public static  void  assertNull(Object c1)
public static  void  assertNotNull(Object c1)
public static  void  assertNotEquals(Object c1, Object c2)
public static  void  assertTrue(boolean exp)
public static  void  assertFalse(boolean exp)


2) TestCase  class
it is  present  in  junit.framework.* 
when  u are   not using Annotation  ur test case  class must Extend 
with TestCase  class
methods
int   countTestCases()
String getName()
TestResult run() executes the Test Cases
void setUp() executes  before  each  test case
void tearDown() executes  after  each test case
void setName(String name)

3) TestResult class
it is  present  in  junit.framework.* 
used to collect the Result of test cases
methods
int errorCount()
int failureCount()
void run(Test t)
int runCount()
void stop()
void startTest(Test t)


4)TestSuite class
used to integrate more than  1  TestCase

methods
int countCases()
String getName()
void run(TestResult r)
void setName(String s)
Test testAt(int index)
int testCount()

Annotaions  in JUNIT  4
@Test
it is  method  level
declares  method as a test method

@BeforeClass
it is static  method level
executes  before all  test cases

@AfterClass
it is static  method level
executes  after all  test cases

@@Before
it is   method level
executes  before each  test cases

@After
it is  method level
executes  after each  test cases

@Ignore
it is  class&method level
ignores  test cases

above annotations are in org.junit.* pkg

@Suite  used  to  create  a Suite test it is  class level

@RunWith  it is  class level  
decide  in wahich  mode test case will execute


@Parameterized
it is  static method level
used to run paramterized test

create  class called  Employee with id name and monsal
write  junit test case  for  follwing

1) name  must be  greater than  6  characters
2)  annual  sal  must be  equal  to   480000



create  a  class called   sigin
with uname and password
write  2 tests cases
1) successlogin
2)failure login

How to write a  Test  Runner class?

Every test case  has  a Result  of True or false
Junit  4  provides a TestRunner class

it provdes  
fllowing classes

JunitCore class used to load the  test cases  org.junit.runner.JUnitCore;
Failure  class  used to  get the Failure information org.junit.runner.notification.Failure;
Result  class use to collect the  TestCase Results   org.junit.runner.Result;




write a  JDBC program  to insert  1  row into book  table in mysql database   by reading data from
keyboard. Create  a  maven project and  generate  jar file  and  insert a  row by excuting
 the  jar file


create   a   class  called  Product  with  id name and  price
insert  5 objects in an ArrayList and Write  Junit test case  to check
the  extracted productList price > 20000



Insert  10 Strings in An array List
and write a test case  wether the size of  array list whcich  contains the  name
starts with letter  'r'  >  5
