Methods  of Collection interface
boolean   add(Object o) adds   one  element to collection
boolean  addAll(Collection c) adds the  elements of one collection to other collection
boolean  remove(Object o)  deletes   one  element from   collection
booolean  removeAll(Collection c)   removes the elements  of   specified   collection
from  invoking collection
boolean  retainAll(Collection c)  removes  elements  of invoking collection except specified
collection
boolean  contains(Object o) checks wether element is present in collection or not?
void  clear() deletes  all elements
int size()  returns size of the collection
Iterator iterator() returns the  iterator of the Collection

List
it is an interface extends Collection interface
it supports  duplicate  null   generic (same data type)  non generic (different data type)
elements
o/p is  insertion order  
works on index basis  0 to n-1


methods  of List interface
void add(int index, Object  o)
Object get(int index)    
Object set(int index, Object o)
Object remove(int index)
Object  remove(Object  o)
ListIterator  listIterator()
int indexOf(Object o)
int lastIndexOf(Object o)

ArrayList
it is a  Class implements  List interface
it supports  duplicate  null   generic (same data type)  non generic (different data type)
elements
o/p is  insertion order  
works on index basis  0 to n-1
modification   is slow  as schuffling of elements required
it works  on one end

contructor
ArrayList()
ArrayList(int size)
ArrayList(Collection c)


Collection frameworks   accepts wrapper  class  data


w.a.p  to find the  sum of integers of  Non generic array list

creating   type  safe collections?
jdk 1.5 support  new feature called   type  generics
denoted by <class name>  symbol   It can be  a user defined/built in class name(wrapper type)
used  to create   type   safe collection

advantages

improves  the type safety
detects  compile time  bugs
eliminates  type casting


it uses <T> <E> <K, V> parameters
also  used to create   Our own Generic  classes   methods e.t.c

Iterating  using Iterator interface
used for List  Queue and Set
it iterates the elements  of collection  in only forward  direction
Iterator  interface  has  3 methods
1)  boolean hasNext()
while  iterating  checks   wether  next element is there or not?

2) Object  next()
retrieves the  element of  current  Iteration
3) void remove()

deletes the element  while iterating

  
Iterating  using ListIterator interface
used for  only List
it iterates the elements  of collection  in forward and  reverse  direction
ListIterator  interface  has  following methods
1)  boolean hasNext()
while  iterating  checks   wether  next element is there or not in while loop?

2) Object  next()
retrieves the  element of  current  Iteration
3)  boolean hasPrevious()
while  iterating  checks   wether previous element is there or not in while loop?

4) Object  previous()
retrieves the  revious element of  current  Iteration


Inserting User  defined  class Objects  in Array List
create a class Product with id, name  category and  price
insert   3 Objects  in ArrayList and Display

Array List is  used to build a  Dynamic Array
u can increase it's  size at a Runtime

Adding  elements  of   2 ArrayLists



LinkedList
it is a  Class implements  List interface
it supports  duplicate  null   generic (same data type)  non generic (different data type)
elements
o/p is  insertion order  
works on index basis  0 to n-1
modification   is fast  as schuffling of elements are  not  required
it works  on both ends  as   internally  it uses  Doubly linked  List
it is fast  compared to ArrayList
Like ArrayList it also builds Dynamic array
contructor
LinkedList()
LinkedList(int size)
LinkedList(Collection c)


it provides   some extra  methods

void addFirst(Object o)
void addLast(Object o)
Object  getFirst()
Object  getLast()
Object removeFirst()
Object removeLast()
Iterator  descendingIterator()


w.a. p   to convert   ArrayList into  LinkedList

Vector?
It is   a  old / legacy class
It contains   extra  methods
Implements  List interface
u can  traverse the elements of Vector  through Iterator/ Enumeration
it also  builds  Dynamic Array
it is   synchronized  / thread safe where
ArrayList and  LinkedList  are not Synchronized

Constructor
Vector()
Vector(Collection c)
Vector(int capacity, int increment)
Vector(int size)

methods
void add(int index, Object o)
void addElement(Object o)
Enumeration  elements()
Object elementAt(int index)
Object  getFirstElement()
Object  getLastElement()
int  capacity()
int size()


Enumeration interface

used to iterate the elements of Legacy / old Collection framework classes
Like  Vector Stack Hashtable  Properties
u can also  traverse the Elements of Vector using Iterator
for loop   for each loop 
it contains   2 methods
boolean   hasMoreElements()

while  iterating  checks   wether  next element is there or not in while loop?

Object nextElement()
retrieves the  element of  current  Iteration

w.a.p  to convert Vector  elements to ArrayList



performing operations on Collection elements

Collection Framework  supports  a  Class called  Collections
It contains  static  methods   which are  used  to perform
operations on List  interface  classes 
Operations  can be sorting searching finding min max element reversing 
e.t.c

methods of  Collections  class

public static  void sort(List l)
public static  void sort(List l, Comparator c)
public static  void reverse(List l)
public static  int min(List l)
public static  int max(List l)
public static  int binarySearch(List l, int searchkey)


w.ap  to insert  7 Strings  in ArrayList and  Sort on  descending order

w.ap  to insert  7 integers  in Vector and  Search for  key element 17


how to sort on   data members  of user  defined  class  stored in Collection?

2  interfaces
1)Comparable  interface
it is  present in lang pkg

used to sort on only one  data members  of user  defined  class  stored in Collection
it has  method  called
public  int compareTo(Object o)
it compares  the  invoking object  with  specified  object
if  invoking obj >   specified object  it returns +ve
if  invoking obj ==   specified object  it returns 0
else  returns -ve

u can  compare  on only 1  data member of user  defined class
like name/age/id. and  sort on only 1  data members  of user  defined  class
  stored in Collection


create  a class called  student  with   id, name and age
and   insert  4 Objects  in LinkedList and  sort on  age

2) Comparator  interface

it is  present in util pkg

used to sort on  1 or more than 1  data members  of user  defined  class  stored in Collection
it has  method  called
public  int compare(Object o1, Object o2)
it compares  the  1st object  with  2nd  object
if  1st obj >   2nd object  it returns +ve
if  1st obj ==   2nd object  it returns 0
else  returns -ve

u can  compare  on 1 / more than 1  data member of user  defined class
like name&age&id. and  sort on only 1 or more than 1  data members  of user  defined  class
  stored in Collection
  
create  a class called  Book with   id, name author and price
and   insert  4 Objects  in ArrayList and  sort on  price and  author 


Queue interface

it has  2 ineterfaces
1)Queue  which extends  Collection  interface
2)Deque  which extends  Queue interface

it does  not supports  null elements
if u entered null elements  it throws  NullPointerException
it supports  duplicate  generic  non generic elements
o/p is insertion order

Methods  of Queue  Interface
void offer(Object o)   void add(Object o)
void push(Object o)
Object element()   returns  top element
Object  peek()    returns top element
Object poll()    removes top element
Object remove()   removes  top element
Iterator descendingIterator()   displays elements in reverse order

2 classes are there
PriorityQueue  impements  Queue interface
Constructor
PriorityQueue()
PriorityQueue(Collection c)
PriorityQueue(int size)

ArrayDeque  impements  Deque interface
Constructor
ArrayDeque()
ArrayDeque(Collection c)
ArrayDeque(int size)




 u can also  traverse elements  of Queue using  iterator

assignments


1) enter   5  names  in ArrayList and  remove  "vinod"  from  arraylist
using  Iterator's remove() method

2) write  a  program  to insert  10 integer elements  in ArrayDeque  
1) sort in ascending order
2) find the  max element


3)create a class called   Country  with name ,  language and  currency
insert  5 objects  in  ArrayDeque and  sort on  Language

4)
create a class called  Student  with name, id, subjectname and  marks
insert  5  objects of Student  in LinkedList and  sort on Marks and  Subjectnames
