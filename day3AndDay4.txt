Data  types  in java
We can  call it as   primitive    datatypes

type    casting


when variable  of one  datatype  is converted into another
variable  data type  it is  called  TYPE CASTING


When    smaller  width  data  type  variable  is  assigned  to  larger
width   data  type  variable  it is  called  IMPLICIT type casting
or  WIDENING



When    larger  width  data  type  variable  is  assigned  to  lower
width   data  type  variable  it is  called  EXPLICIT type casting
or  NARROWING




public class One {
public static void main(String[] args) {

    byte   b=50;
    b=b*2;
   System.out.println(b);
}}


how to read   data/input from key board?


java.util package   provides
Scanner  class


used to read   i/p from keyboard
it breaks the  i/p   into  tokens
default  token is  space


Constructor
Scanner(InputStream i)


keyboard  =>  System.in


methods


int nextInt()   reads  integer
String  next()   raeds   String
String  nextLine() reads  String with  spaces

double  nextDouble() reads   double
float  nextFloat()  reads float

e.t.c
99.99989318847656
99.99989


w.a. p to find   sum of  2 no  using command line arguments


rules  to write  a  class  in java

1)  in java   class name which  contains  main method
and  the  file name you saved must  be  SAME

2)  u can  write   more than  one class in a  program 
but   only   one class must be  public   which  must  contain main  method

3)   top level class   can  have   public   / no  (default) access  specifiers

top  level  class  cannot be private/protected


Operators
java   supports  following operators
arithmatic operators
+ - / * += -= /= *=  ++ -- %
relational   operators
> < >= <= == !=

bit wise logical operators
uses  1's and 0's
 | & ^ ~ &= |= ^=  >>  <<   


1010
1111


left shiff   

add   specified  no of  0's  to right side

right  shift

remove   specified no of DIGITS  from  right side

1010000  64+16

130

10000010

1111

0110
1010

1100

in exor  2  0's  or  2  1's   gives 0


boolean logical operators

here   instead  of  0/1   we use   true  false
 | &  !  


short cercuit && ||  operators

above operators not used for    bite wise  no

in case of &&  if  condition of 1st  expression is  true it it will check
condition of 2nd expression
else   it  will not check  2nd expr

in case of ||  if  condition of 1st  expression is  false it it will check
condition of 2nd expression
else   it  will not check  2nd expr


ternary operator

syntax
var s=expression condition ?   value1:value2





if   expression condition is true   value1  is assigned to s

else  value2  is assigned to s




loops

controls statements  like if
if else  if else  ladder  and  nested  if


loops   for  for each    nested  for loop   for  with comma

while  loop  do while  loop

jump statements

switch case  continue break
  continue with label  (acts as  goto)
   break withy label  (acts as  goto)


if(condition)
{
 statement;
}

nested  if
if(condition)
 {
 statement;
    if(condition)
{
   statement;
}
}

if(condition)
  {
 statement;
}
    else
{
 statements
}



if else  ladder

it evaluates   any boolean expression
uses  SHORT CERCUITE &&  || OPERATORS

slow  compared to switch case




while   loop
syntax

while(condition)
{
 body;
}


in this  if the  condition expr   is  first time  only false
then   body  of the loop  never executes  single  time



write   a  program  to check   wether   enetered  no is  arm strong or not



armstrong no=sum of cubes   153



int   a=168;
byte b=(byte)a;
S.O.P(b)
-88





do while   loop
syntax
do
{
 body;
}
while(condition);



in this  if the  condition of expr   is  first time  only false
then   body  of the loop   executes  ATLEAST 1 time   

for  loop


synatx
for(initialization;condition;iteration)
{
   body;
}


array

array is   sequence  of  contiguous  elements of  SAME  data  type
array is  static

works on index basis

u can  randomly access the element

types  of array
1) single  dimensional  array
2) multi dimensional  array

declaring   single  dimensonal  array


int a[]=new int[10];  // declaring and  intantiating an array

index  of above array is 0 to 9



int a[]={22,11,55,66,77,88} // declaring and  initializing an array

write  a  program to insert  10 integer  elements  in an array sort on ascending order

2  dimesional  array

int  a[][]=new int[3][3];
int  a[][]=new int[3][];


int a[][]={{1,2,1}, {33,33,22}, {55,66,77}};




for  each  loop is also called   enhanced  for loop

it is  introduced  in  jdk 1.5



for  reading i/p from key board  for    2d matrix  uisng enhanced for  loop
inner loop must be  always    non  for  each loop
outer loop can be for each loop



import java.util.Scanner;

public class five {
public static void main(String[] args) {
	Scanner   sc=new Scanner(System.in);
	System.out.println("enter the  row and col   size");
	int m=sc.nextInt();
	int n=sc.nextInt();
	int a[][]=new int[m][n];
	
	System.out.println("enter the elements");
	for(int[] e:a)
	{
		 
		for(int e1=0; e1<e.length;e1++)
		{
			e[e1]=sc.nextInt();
		}
	}
	System.out.println(" elements are");
	for(int[] e:a)
	{
		for(int e1:e)
		{
	System.out.print(e1+"  ");
		}
		System.out.println();
	}
}
}


jump statements

switch  case

it evelauates  boolean expression based on case value
it is  fast compared  to  if else ladder
as it knows the data  type of the case  value
u can  nest  switch  within the  switch
if  u r using  non nested  switch  then  each case  value must be  different
break statement  in each case  exits from  switch

syntax
switch(expression)
{
    case   value: statement;
                  break;

default:
 break;
}


expression can be int byte short   string char  



write a program   to create   a  jagged array
0
1 2
3 4 5
6 7 8 9
10 11 12 13 14


write  a  program  to implemet selection sort  (don't use oops  concepts)

write  a program  to generate   "n" fibonessi" numbers

write a  program  to   find the  sum of digits


break  and   continue

break   exits  from the  loop

syntax

if(condition) break;
if(condition) break label;


continue   exits  from the  current  iteration of  the loop



if(condition) continue;
if(condition) continue label;


difference  between  JVM JRE & JDK?

JVM  : Java  vertual machine
it is an interpreter  for byte code
used  to load  / execute/ varify the  byte code
provides  run time environment  to execute  byte  code
provides  register  set,  class file  format,  heaps  to store   un referenced objects  
(garbage collected heap)
it is not visible
it is  platform dependent


JRE
java   runtime  environment
it is    collection of  JVM +   set of  class  libraries
u can execute  program   with  only JRE  also  through IDE
IT is  visible

JDK
java   development kit
it is    collection of  JRE+development tools like  java javac appletviewer  rmic  e.t.c
u can execute  program   with  only JRE  also  through IDE
IT is  visible


architechtutre og  jvm

what happens  after  java  program  gets  compiled?



architecture  of  JVM


JVM  : Java  vertual machine
it is an interpreter  for byte code
used  to load  / execute/ varify the  byte code
provides  run time environment  to execute  byte  code
provides  register  set,  class file  format,  heaps  to store   un referenced objects  
(garbage collected heap)
it is not visible
it is  platform dependent


IT has  following  components


1) class  loader  : when the   byte code is generated it is  travelling around the N/W
class loader loads the  class file
2)  byte code varifier:from  the  class loader  byte code  travels to  byte
code varifier and  varifies the  byte code  for the  illegal code

3)execution engine
it contains  2  parts  
1) interpreter converts the  whole  byte code into executable  code
2) JIT compiler   converts   piece  by piece byte code into executable  code


4)   PC register:  it contains  the   current  byte  code instruction  which is  going
to be executed

5)  Native  method  stack: it contains  native method interface  which uses  java  native
libarries  which are  used to call  other  programs  which are  not wriiten in java


java  usually   contains   3  memory areas

1)  stack area
it contains  local  variables   objects  method  code
&  temporary results  
plays  vital  role  in invoking methods

it also  contains primitive data  types

2)  heap  area
contains  the  variable   declared at  run time
contains  values  for  the  class  level varaibles(instance  varaibles)
contains  values  for  variables  allocated at  run time
3)  class area
contains the  static  variables   which are shared among multiple objects
used for  memory utilization



Eg
  class  Student
{
      int id;
     String  name;
     static   String cname="oxford";


      void  insert(int id1, String name1)
{
           id=id1;
   name=name1;
}

         void   d()
{
    System.out.println(id+"\t"+name+"\t"+cname);
  }
 main..................................
{
       Student s=new Student();
        s.insert(1,"ajay");
       s.d();
 Student s1=new Student();
        s1.insert(2,"vijay");
       s1.d();
 
}}

here   id, name  are stored  in HEAP AREA   
here  s, id1, name1  are  the  local varaibles stored in  stack area


here   cname is static   stored  in class area  accessed  by  s&s1 objects



Object  oriented Programming  in java


class  
objects 
methods
method overloading  constructor  this  static  nested  classes

inheritance  method overriding runtime plolymorphism
upcasting downcasting super final abstract class  interfaces  packages init block access specifiers



object  oriented  programming is  dividing the  program  into  methods  objects
and classes
in this  we can achieve  the  readability,  code reusability and  code optimization
through  methods
u can maintain the  code  if the  application code  grows very large
in this  global  data  is  not available  every where  to  access


class:

it   is  a template  /  blue  print for an  object
it is  container for  data and code
the  methods  variables and  blocks  of the class are  called
members  of class


syntax

accessspecifier class classname
{
 constructors()
{}
     varaibles;
   methods()
{}
  blocks{}
}
Note  : any operation  must be performed either  in methods/blocks/contructors

for  the  top level class  only public / default  access specifier is used
class a
{
   System.out.println("Hi");//   not allowed
public static  void main(String [] args)
{

}
}


variables
3  types  of variables

1) instance variable:   variables  declared at class level are  called instance  varaibles

   Ex:
  class Person
{
   int age;// instance variable 
String name//   instance  varaible

}


2) local variable:   variables  declared inside method/constructor/block
are calles local  varibles.  Note  :
 u cannot  use  static  keyword to declare  local variables

 class  Student
{
      int id;   // instance varaible
     String  name;// instance  variable
     static   String cname="oxford";


      void  insert(int id1, String name1) // id1,  name1  are local variable
{
           id=id1;   
   name=name1;
}

3)   class varaibles: varaibles  decalred  at the  class level with static  key word
are called class  varaibles stored in class area
cannot be  declared  in methods class  Student
{
      int id;   // instance varaible
     String  name;// instance  variable
     static   String cname="oxford";// class variable
}

methods

methods   contains  business logic
it conatins the  behaviour of the  class


if the  methods  have  body/ implementation  it is called   concrete methods

if the  methods  does not have  body/ implementation  it is called abstract methods


concrete methods

syntax
u can use    any  access specifier for methods


public  void m()
{
   System.out.println("hi");
}

such  methods  cannot be  invoked  in println statements

above one  is called  void method




if the  method returns  any thing then it's  body must end with  return key word
such  methods  can be  invoked  in println statements

public  int  cube(int i)
{
   return i*i*i;
}

objects
it is  real world entity
it is an instance  of a class
it can be a name of person thing place  product  e.t.c
it has 3 properties
1)  state: represents the  attributes of the object
if the laptop is an object it's price/color/brand/model are  called state

2) behaviour: represents the  functionality of the object
if  person  is a object behaviour can be
writing/walking/sleeping
it is  represented in the  form of method

3) id: represents the  reference id of an object
java compiler provides a reference  id for each object when each time new object
is created it is a  fully qualified  hexa decimal value
Eg   praveen.Person@hgkafh679  //   reference  id 

how to create  Object

1) using  new key word
2)  using factory method
3) using newInstance method of class Class
4) using clone() method of Object class


using  new keyword

it allocates  memory  to the  objects  dynamically at  runtime @contiguous location

these will be  stored  in HEAP area

Syntax

class Man
{

  int id;String name;

}
public static  void main(String[] args
{
    Man m;   //  m is  null;
    m=new Man();//   m can access the  instance  varaibles of  Man class

    OR
Man m=new Man()

}
}

Create  a class called  Calculator   and  find the  sum and  product of 2  no
using  methods  objects (oops)


create   a  class  called Stdent  with id name and age
create   Student array  of   3 and  insert  id name and age and display
from  keyborad  using oops



method   overloading

in  a  same   class  when more than  1  method is defined  with  same name
but  different NO OF parameter
OR
in  a  same   class  when more than  1  method is defined  with  same name
same no of parameters But   data type  of  parameters  is  different

Then  this is called  "METHOD OVERLOADING"
it is also called  Compile  time polymorphism



public class Mo {
   void m(int a, long b)
   {
	   System.out.println("int long");
	   System.out.println(a+b);
   }
   void m(long a, int b)
   {
	   System.out.println("long int");
	   System.out.println(a+b);
   }   
   public static void main(String[] args) {
	   Mo me=new Mo();
	   me.m(11,11);
	   me.m(1, 2);
}
}


method  overloading  also   possible   when u overload the methods  with returns  some thing

class A
{
    float  m(double a, double b)
{
      return  a+b;
}
    String m(char  a, char b)
{
      return a+b;
}

main...........
{
     A aa=new A();
     s.o.p(aa.m(33.22,11.22);
      s.o.p(aa.m('t', 'a'));
}
}

advantages
imporove  readability
code optimization
code reusability


constructors

contructors  are  used to initialize the state  of the  object
if the  java  program  does  not contain   contructor then  compiler
 creates the  default constructor
contructor   looks   similiar  to methods  in syntax but does not have  return type
contructors  can also  have  private/public/default and protected access specifiers

apart from initializing  the  values/object  constructors  also  does  other
functionalities  like  starting the thread  e.t.c

contructors name  must be same as class name
u can   perform   business logic in constructors
contructors  can also  be overloaded

Syntax

class  Person
{
     Person()   // default constructors
{}
}



2  types of   constrcutors

1)    default   2) parameterized

if the  contructors are private  then  they   cannot be instantiated from  out of the class


this   keyword

it is  used to refer  a   current class  instance   variable
Syntax: this.instancevarname;

it is   also  used to  invoke  the  current  class  constructor

u can also   use  this   key word  to invoke the current class  constructor
in this  case  call to this()   must  be  always  first  statement in the  constructor
other  wise  u wll  get  compile time error
Syntax:
this();   this(a);  this(a,b);
It is  also  constructor chaining  where  u  can call one  contructor
from  another  constructor  order  must  top to bottom

Find   sum of  2  and  3  nos


it is  also  used to invoke the current  class method




used as  parameter  in method  call

note  : this  key  word  cannot be  used in static context





create   a class  called  Employee   with  id, name   des and  basic  salary
read  these  from  key board
and   calculate  net salary
net salary=   basic  salary+ da(150%bs)+hra(30%bs)-tax(2%bs)

use   constructors and  methods




            this
 ------------------------>Object






static   keyword

static  key word is applied  to  nested classes  instance variables   methods
and block

static  key word is NOT applied  to  TOP LEVEL classes  LOCAL variables  
and Constructors


static   to a instance variable

syntax  
public static  int a=100;


when  u apply static  to a  instance  variable   they  will be stored in class area
these  varaibles  get  the  values at the class loading time
static varaibles  shared  among multiple  objects
they  represents the  common properties of the Object like
emps of same company  students of same college
used for memory  utilization
these varaible  cannot be used in  costructors  for  initilaization
u can modify static variables
cannot  be used with this  keyword

write   program  to implement  copy  constructor  in java
used to copy the  values of one obj to other  object

write  a program  to prove  that this  key word is  used  to  refers a current
class instance  varaible

create  a class called  Student with  id, name  subname and  marks
Create  array   3  students and  enter  above info and display
use   constructors   and methods
