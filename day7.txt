String class

String   m(char  s, char y)  //error
{
    return  s+y;    //   adds    ascii  letters
}

as String is  a class  
char  is  primitive type


String is   sequence  of IMMUTABLE  characters

immutable  means  cannot be  changed  /  modified / not altered


class   A extends  String 
{}
above    code  will give  error  as   String is  IMMUTABLE  class
internally  it is  final  class. It cannot be sub classed



Implicitely  String class  impelemnts    
java.io.Serializable, Comparable<String>, CharSequence  interfaces


HOW  to create  a  String
2 ways   to create  a  String

1) using  String constructor

String()
String(char[] c)
String(String s)


it create    a  String   in  heap area

String s1=new String("welcome");
String s2=new String("welcome");


In  the   above  code    2  Strings  are  created  in HEAP area


char  c[]={'w','e','l','c','o','m','e'};
String s1=new String(e);
System.out.println(s1)   // produces  welcome  in HEAP area


2)  using Literal  technique
String  s="welcome"
Here   s is  stored  in  String  Constant  Pool   in HEAP area
For Eg
String  s="welcome"
String  s1="welcome"

in the   above  statement   only  1 welcome  is stored in String Constant Pool


why strings are   Immutable  in java

if     5  reference  varaibles  are  refers to  same   String Object
if any one referece  variable changes value of  that  String Object   it effects to
other  reference  varaibles also That is why Strings are  IMMUTABLE



what  is  O/P?


String   s="naveen";
s.concat("kumar");
System.out.println(s);    // prints   naveen  as    no reference variable  is  pointed  
to naveenkumar



methods  of String class
boolean   equals(String s)     compares the   values of  2 Strings
boolean  ==   compares the references of  2 Strings
int   compareTo(String s)  compares  values of  2 Strings 
if  both are  equal  it returns  0  if 1st Str  >  2nd Str  it returns  +ve
else  returns  negative  (+ve / -ve  values are  diff between  ascii values)
boolean  equalsIgnoreCase(String s) compares  values of 2 Strings  by ignoring cases
int   compareToIgnoreCase(String s)  compares  values of  2 Strings 


char    charAt(int index)   extracts  one  character  of  a String at a  Time
int  indexOf(String s)  returns    the  index   of a String where  first  time  ocuured
int  lastIndexOf(String s)  returns    the  index   of a String where  LAST time  ocuured
String   substring(int startindex, int end index)  returns the  sub String 
boolean startsWith(String s)
boolean  endsWith(String s)
String  toUpperCase()
String toLowerCase()
String[]   split(String  pattern)
String  trim()
String  intern()  returns duplicate  copy  of String
static  String   valueOf(Object  o) converts  java object  to string
void   getChars(int start, iny end, char[] buf,  int startarrayindex)
extracts  more than  1 character 
byte[] getBytes() converts  to byte
int length()   returns  length of String
String concat(String  s)  concatenates the  2 Strings
String replace( char  old, char new)
char[]   toCharArray()   converts to array

w.ap   to  extract  more than  1 character  in String
by reading  string from keyboard
use  getChars()  method

this is a demo of getchars method
demo
0   empty
1   d
2   e
3   m


w.a.p   to  count  no of  Vowels   in a  String  using  switch  case




How   to create   Mutable characters  of String?

String Buffer and String Builder classes

StringBuffer
used  to create   Mutable/changable/modifiable  characters  of String
it is   very  slow  as it is   Synchronized
i.e   not more than one thread   cannot   access the  same   method
of String Buffer  symultaneously
i.e at a  time  only one thread can access   StringBuffer method


Constructors

StringBuffer()
StringBuffer(int  size)
StringBuffer(String s)

Internally StringBuffer is also  final
but used to create  Mutable  sequence of characters
methods

int capacity()
default is   16
if u enter    characters >  16   & < 35  then capacity  is  oldcapacity*2+2

if  u enter characters  > 34   then  capacity =   no of characters

void  setCharAt(int index, char c)
sets the character
void setLength(int length)
StringBuffer  append(String s)   adds   strings at end
StringBuffer  insert(int s, String s)   adds   string at specific position
StringBuffer  delete(int start, int end)  delete  specific characters
StringBuffer  replace(int start, int end, String s)   replace string
StringBuffer  reverse()
StringBuffer  deleteCharAt(int i)



convert    Hello  to hi  using StringBuffer  methods


w.ap to compare  2  String Buffer  value?


w.a.p  to    check entered String is  pallindrome  or not  using   String/StringBuffer
method

StringBuilder
used  to create   Mutable/changable/modifiable  characters  of String
it is   very  fast  as it is not  Synchronized
i.e    more than one thread   can   access the  same   method
of StringBuilder  symultaneously
i.e at a  time more than one thread can access   StringBuilder methods  parallelly


Constructors

StringBuilder()
StringBuilder(int  size)
StringBuilder(String s)

Internally StringBuilder is also  final
but used to create  Mutable  sequence of characters
methods

contains  same methods as  StringBuffer



write a  program to create  a  class product  with  id name and  price
and create   1 object and  display



toString()   method
it is a  method  of  Object  class
converts  User defined class Object  into String


note:   when u  display object  compiler  internally calls  toString() method
u need to override in your  program  
to convert  object to string


Exception  handling


Exception is an  abnormal   condition   occured  in code  sequnce at  runtime
when   exception  ocuured  and  not handeled then   it   will terminate the program
abnormally and   we can't maintain the smooth flow of an  application


if the  exception occured  in a  method  then  in that  method
if  we  handled it or transfered  to another method for  processing / handling
thus  occured   exeption  some  how  handled  or processed
if  we handled the  exception  then the program terminates  normally
and  we can maintain smooth  flow of an appllication
The  process of  handling exception  in code sequence  at  run time
is called "EXCEPTION HANDLING"






Exception   Hierachy

super  class  of Exception class is Throwable
Under  throwable  we have  Exception class and  Error class

Exception class  has  2 types
1)  CheckedException
these extends  Throwable class except  RuntimeException and  Error
These exception Occur at  compile  time
These  are  not occured  due  to developer mistakes
these are not under the  control of developers
there are  used  lot in throws  key word
occurs  due some  of  java built in methods  throws  exceptions

eg:
IOException  ClassNotFoundException
InterruptedException  SQLException CloneNotSupportedException

2)  Un CheckedException
these extends  Throwable class 
These exception Occur at  Runtime  time
It's  super class  is RuntimeException
These  are  occured  due  to developer mistakes
these are  under the  control of developers
there are also used in throws  key word


eg:
ArithmaticException  NullPointerException
ClassCastException  NumberFormatException ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
StringIndexOutOfBoundsException IllegalThreadStateException


Error   
it
realtes  to   JVM error
these are  irrocoverable

StackOverFlow
AssertionError
VMError
OutOfMemory error   e.t.c


Write  a  program  to insert     8 strings  from keyboard   
and  store  in an array and sort  on  asscending order
