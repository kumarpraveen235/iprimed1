How to   handle   Exception?
there  are  5  key words are there to handle  an Exception
try
catch 
throw
throws and
finally

try  and catch block

try:it is  a  block  of  code  which may contain  or  or   which may not contain error

catch:it  is  also called   handler  used to  handle  an exception
always  written  immmediately  after  try  block

syntax
try
{
     code;
}

   catch(Excetion  e)
 {
    statements;
}

Note   :  min no of catch  block  for  each  try block  is  1 if (finally block not used)

try & catch   must be used  in the  method/contructors/blocks
At a  time    only one exception   is  occured  in each try  catch   block and  
1  exception is  handled  in each try-catch  block


public class One {
public static void main(String[] args) {
	System.out.println("welcome".charAt(10));
}
}

in the   above  program   RunTIME exception java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException
occured.  In  this code  exception occurs in 3rd line. 
  first  java  compiler checks  wether   exception  handler
is  used  or not? if  it is  used then    Exception got handled and  rest  of the
code  executes  and  program  terminates  normally.
If java  compiler finds that  no  exception handler used  then  It  uses it's  own
exception handler (default handler) and  prints the stack trace by terminating program
abnormally
Stack trace  is a  information of error   printed  through  System.err stream
contains  exception name,type, line  no , method name  class name  e.t.c

if   handler  in catch block  is  not equal(NOT MATCHES)  to the  exception   occured  in try  block
then    again   java  compiler  uses  default   exception handler and prints stack trace
and terminates the program  abnormally


if   handler  in catch block  is Exception then  it is  super class of  all exceptions
(checked/un checked) so    here     java  program   handles the exception
and  terminates  the program  noramally by executing REST OF CODE

try  catch   block has  may forms

1) try   with  multiple  catch
2) nested  try
3)   try  catch  in catch



try with   multiple catch


u can also   write  more than one  catch  for  each try block
syntax
try
{
     code;
}
catch(subclassexception e){}
catch(subclassexception e){}
catch(subclassexception e){}
catch(superclassexception e){}



when  u r  writing multiple  catch  blocks
all  the   Exceptions  in catch  blocks  must be specified in an order

i.e  first  all  sub class exceptions  must be specified
at last  super class exception is  specified
other  wise  u  will get un reachable code  compile time error



u can  also write  multiple  catch  block  for  each try block
in a single  catch  block  by  saperating  multiple sub class exceptions  by |

note  :   in one  catch  block  u can  use  only  multiple
sub class  excepions  
don't use   super class exception with  sub class exception

it is  introdced in 1.7


nested try

u can also   write  try within try

syntax
try
{
  statement
try
{
    statement
}   // inner   try  close
   catch(exception e)
{}
}   // outer  try close

   catch(exception e)
{} 


we can also   write try catch  in catch

in this  case  Exception object name of  outer  catch  must be different
than Exception object name of  inner  catch

throw   key word

 when u want to  manulally   throw  an  Exception  we  can do it with the  help of throw
keyword

syntax
throw   throwableinstance;

here  throwable instance  must be of the  type  throwable

Eg
 throw  new  ArithmaticException();
 throw  new  IOException()
  throw new SQLException("dataaccesserror");



Note:
u can manually  throw checked and  unchecked  exceptions  using throw  keyword
u cannot throw multiple  excetions  using  throw
u cannot write  any  statements  after throw
throw must be used in method
throw  must follow object
u can cnnaot use  more than 1 throw  in a method
when u  throw  checked/super class exceptions  using throw  that must be 
sorrounded  with try catch block/ DECLARE   that method  with throws   keyword

w.a.p  to enter  a  no  from keyboard  if no is +ve   display no
if  u entered  -ve  no  throw  ArithmaticException and  handle it

throws  keyword

in  java   some  methods  of built in classes  throws   Exceptions
like  Thread class  sleep() method throws  InterruptedException
InputStream's  read()  close() method throws  IOException
when developer  use these  method  in  his program  these  generate
compile  time error (CheckedException)  To  eliminate  these  error

either  we use  try catch or declare  method  with  throws  key word

features

throws key word is  used  in method  signature
it must follow class
used to declare an  exception
u can  declare   multiple  exceptions  using throws  keyword
used  to declare  checked and  un checked exceptions

throws  is also used  when  in a method   u manually throw an CHECKED EXCEPTION 
uisng throw  keyword then  that method must be declared  using throws keyword


3  scenarios
1)  method  contains exception and  hendled  and  method dcelared with throws  keyword
2)  method  contains exception and NOT handled  and  method dcelared with throws  keyword
3)  method does not  contains exception  dcelared with throws  keyword



finally   keyword

it is  a block of code   which is  always  going to be executed  wether  exception
is occured  or not occured
if the  exception  occured but  not handled  then also   finally  executes
finally always  executes  after  try  or  try catch
if the  method return  some  thing then also  finally  executes  before
method returns  to caller
finally always  executed by JVM at very LAST MOMENT before terminating the program
developper  write a  code  related  to closing  of resources like
file/socket/connection  close  in finally block as  it is executed by JVM just
before terminating program
finally  will   not be executed if developer  exits  from  the  program
using System.exit(0)
u can write  try catch finally in finally

finally will be written  along with try-finally  or
try-catch-finally

Note   for each try/try catch  there  will be only 1  finally  block
Syntax
try
{
      code;
}
   catch(Exception e)
{}
finally
{
    code;
}
OR
try
{
      code;
}
 
finally
{
    code;
}

3  scenarios
1) finally   with method  contains exception and  handled 
2) finally with method  contains exception and NOT handled
3) finally with method does not  contains exception 


assignments
1) w.a.p to read  age from   key borad
if   age > 17   display    "you r   eligible  to vote"
else
  throw Exception and  handle  it


2)   wap to   rethrow an exception  using throw  keyword   in  catch  block and  handle it

3)  wap  to  illustrate   try catch  block is written  in finally  block


void m()
{
     throw  Arithex;
}
main
{
     try 
{
  m()
}
catch(Arith)
{
    rethrow  exception

    }
}


void m()
{
    try
{
   .....
}
   catch(.....)
{
     }
finally
{
    .......

  try
{
    ....
}
   catch(.....)
{
}

}


write  a  program check  entered  no is  armstrong or not
if  no >  o    check it
else  throw  ArithmeticException and Handle it


if   stack is empty / full  throw ArithmeticException and  handle it
