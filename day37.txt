To develop   MVC application   with ZERO   configuration  file
we  need to create   2 class
1)  for   web.xml
we need to create  a  class   which extends 
AbstractAnnotationConfigDispatcherServletInitializer    class

u need to override  3 methods

Class[]     getRootConfifClasses()
Class[]  gerServletConfigClasses()
String[]      getServletMappings()
above class is present in
import org.springframework.web.servlet.support.AbstractAnnotationConfigDispatcherServletInitializer;
pkg
2) for spring-servlet.xml
we   need to create  another  class  which implements WebMvcConfigurer  interface
this interface is present in
import org.springframework.web.servlet.config.annotation.WebMvcConfigurer  pkg
this  class  must  be   annotated   with
@Configuration
@ComponentScan
@EnableWebMvc annoattion
@EnableWebMvc annoattions  enables
Spring MVC annoattions   it is equivalent  to
<mvc:annotation-driven/> tag
it is present in
org.springframework.web.servlet.config.annotation.EnableWebMvc pkg


develop   spring mvc  to crate  2  text fields   name and age
and display  use   java  configuration



Spring REST
REST  means  Representation State   Transffer
It is    type  of  web service   (architectural style)

web service:
it is  a  service  resides  on internet
Eg     Reservation service   Banking Service   e.t.c
when client   request  for  the   perticular  service
request hits to web service  and  webservice  process the client request
through server
and response is generated to client


REST  web services   always  performed through   client  server architecture
i.e  client sends  request to server  server  process the request  and   response

gets  generated.  Here   request  will sent by client  using HTTP protocol
interaction between client and server  is stateless  as HTTP  is  a stateless
protocol  i.e  HTTP does not maintain any info about client request

when  every time client sends the request to server  it is  a new request to server

By using COOKIES  SESSION TRACKING we can make interaction between client
and server statefull
here  client is called PRODUCER
server  is   called CONSUMER

REST  supports   multiple data  types  like
JSON  XML   EXCEL IMAGE  TEXT   e.t.c

The  heart   of REST  is  url / uri
any resource  u want to  identify  then   url  is  one  which  identifies it
url  is   hera  a  resource

spring mvc   support  built in  REST    web service
u need   confifure   jackson dependencies
which are 
 jackson-databind
jackson-annotation
jackson-core

these   depenedecies  converts  java type  to  json type
in spring     if  u are   not  mapping data  through java object
then REST uses  HTML/TEXT as  default data  type

in spring     if  u are     mapping data  through java object
then REST uses JSON as  default data  type

operations  of REST   architecture
GET  used   to get the  resource  dynamically
for this REST support  @GetMapping annotation
it is present in  org.springframweork.web.bind.annotation.* pkg
it is   equivelent  to
@GetMapping("/get")    at a method level
OR

@RequestMapping(value="/get", method=RequestMethod.GET)

POST
POST  used   to SAVE/INSERT/ADD the  resource  dynamically
for this REST support  @PostMapping annotation
it is present in  org.springframweork.web.bind.annotation.* pkg
it is   equivelent  to
@PostMapping("/save")    at a method level
OR

@RequestMapping(value="/save", method=RequestMethod.POST)

PUT
PUT  used   to UPDATE the  resource  dynamically
for this REST support  @PutMapping annotation
it is present in  org.springframweork.web.bind.annotation.* pkg
it is   equivelent  to
@PutMapping("/update")    at a method level
OR

@RequestMapping(value="/update", method=RequestMethod.PUT)



DELETE
DELETE  used   to DELETE the  resource  dynamically
for this REST support  @DeleteMapping annotation
it is present in  org.springframweork.web.bind.annotation.* pkg
it is   equivelent  to
@DeleteMapping("/delete")    at a method level
OR

@RequestMapping(value="/delete", method=RequestMethod.DELETE)


apart from   above annotations REST module also  support  other  annotations
1)@RestController
it is  introduced  in    spring 4.0
@RestController=@ResponseBody+@Controller
it is  class level annottaion

when  u develop the Rest application  want to show to o/p  on  browser
through  json  data type/ xml data type  then  we annotate   a class
with @RestController annoattion
U can  integate such application with   angular react  for front end
when  u develop the web mvc application  want to show to o/p  on  browser
through  JSP UI  then  we annotate   a class
with @Controller annoattion
it is present in  org.springframweork.web.bind.annotation.* pkg

2)@ResponseBody
it is present in  org.springframweork.web.bind.annotation.* pkg
it is  method level annotation
used to return  response  on browser throgh  xml/json /html/text data type
if  u annotate  a  class with @RestController annotattion
this  annotation  is not used
But
when  u develop the web rest application  want to show to o/p  on  browser
through json/xml/html/text data  types  and  ur class annoatted  with @Controller
annoattion the  method must annotate with @ResponseBody annotation

3)@PathVariable 
it is   a  field  level annottaion  used to inject
i/p  values  for  the  URL  parameters  dynamically
Eg
@GetMapping("/get/{name}")
public   String  show(@PathVariable("name")String n)
{}

4)@RequestBody
it is also  a  Field level annotation
used   provide   input  to parameters  in  the  body  of the  request
through POST method


create  a class  called  Emp  with id name  age   sal
insert   5 objects in array list and display


write   a  program to find  addition of  2  nos  using post  method


develop a  CRUD  application   on 
class Product
{
   int id;
String name;
   int price;
}


You can achieve the  Trasaction Handling  in spring  when u integrated with 
hiberbate using
@Transactional Annotation
it is  class/method  level annotation
it is present in org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Transactional;
also  u need to configure in xml file
by specifying tx  name space  in  spring servlet  configuration xml file



when handling trasaction  with spring  and  not with hibernate

Session is created  in Hibernate  through

SessionFactory's  getCurrentSession() method
not with openSession() method
If u are handling transction in hibernate
then  u can  create  session in hibernate  with openSession() method
