SPRING BOOT  DATA JPA REST CRUD APPLICATION   with validation   +  ANGULAR



class  Employee
int id;
String name;
String des;
Date  doj;
int salary;


Spring Boot Actuators
THESE ARE THE  end points   lets  us to monitor      and interact with our application
Spring actuator is a    spring  boot sub moduleand provides  built in end pints   that  
we can enable and disable    for  our applications

these  end points are  exposed over HTTP
Most of the time  we use   HTTP  based actuator endpoints
because they easy to access over the  browser


we  can access these end points
by configuring
spring-boot-starter-actuator depenedency in the pom.xml of spring boot projects


following  are actuator end points
beans : lists  all the  beans  configured in your application
env: info about the  spring environment properties
health:  shows application health
info: displays  application  information
mappings: display the  list  of @RequestMappings  paths
shutdown:   shutsdown the application
threaddump  provides  threaddump of the application

except  health  the  end points are  diabled
to enable the  endpoint  we need  to use  following  property

YAML  configuration
(YET ANOTHER  MARK UP LANGUAGE)
file  must be  saved  as  .yml /  .yaml
it is  used  instead  of properties  file

it   is  super script  of jason

it uses  following syntax

in properties  file
server.port=9999
spring.datasource.url
spring.datasource.username


in yaml file
server:
   port: 9999
spring:
  datasource:
      url:
      username:
      password

if i use  both   spring boot considers   properties  file  configuration



how  to reload the  changes   without  restarting the server?
If we made any changes in the  spring boot application
to effect those  changes   we just add
devtools  dependency
then if we made any changes   then  u will get those  changes  to  application
with out restarting the / re launching the application

How  to consume   REST  WEB SERVICES?
4 WAYS
1)  using  POST MAN tools
2)  running    REST applications  to  cross  pltforms  like  angular react
3)  writing  conusmer program using RestTemplate class
4)   using Swagger  REST  Documentation API


RestTemplate class
it is present in  org.springframework.web.client.*  pkg
used  to Consume the   Rest services
RestTemplate is a central  class within the  Spring Framework
for  Executing the Synchronous Http Requests  on the  Client  Side

Features  of RestTemplate
creating URL object
opening/establishing  Connection   with server  where  REST endpoint is running
Configuring  HTTP requests
interpretation of http responses
converting the http response to java object
Exception Handling


methods  of RestTemplate  class
T  getForObject(String url,  Class c)
returns the  response Directly

ResponseEntity<T> exchange(String url, HttpMethod type, HttpHeaders  headers,
Class c)
returns Response Entity   that  contains  both  HttpStatusCode
and resource
HttpStatusCode   contains Error  codes
200   success   201   resource  created
300
400    client   side  errors   404  not found

500   server   side  errors 
ResponseEntity class is  present in
org.springframework.http.* pkg
holds the response of Rest  Request Method
methods  of ResponseEntity
String getBody()
returns   Response Body

HttpMethod
it contains  static  fields as  method name  like GET POST PUT DELETE
 present in
org.springframework.http.* pkg
HttpHeaders
used  to set  data  type  for  the  request


T  getForEntity(String url, Class c, Map paraneters)
executes  GET request  and  returns  respnse entity that contains
both status  code  and  resource

T postForObject(String url, Object o,   Class c)
processes the POST request and returns and saves  response


T postForEntity(String url, Object o,  Class c)
processes  the POST request
and returns response entity that contains  both status code and resource
void delete(String url, Map parameters)
process delete request
void put(String url,  Object o, Map parameters)
process the PUT request and updates resources


For  the morning  REST CRUD  application
write the  consumer  program


apply  validation for   Angular side  for  mornig   RestCrud   example
