Routing
routing is  concept  in which   one  compoennt can be accessed from another component
WITHOUT RELOADING the page
steps

1)import the  router  module   in app.module.ts
and specify it in  imports array

2)to navigate   from   1 component to other  component
we use <a [routerLink]=["path"]/>  in template  file
<router-outlet/>
used to  specify the  location  of   displaying the  component  contents


3)create  a  router table  of  type  Routes
it is a array which tells
the  path name  and  component  name

4) configure the  router table in the  imports  array(app.module.ts)

in the   RouterModule's  forRoot method

Routing   with  parameters
used  to access the  URL  parameters

in the  router table 
parameters  in the  url  path can be specified  by
pathname/:id

id is   paramter name

in the  component class   parameters  can be  obtained/retrieved by using   the
AcivatedRoute objects'  params.subscribe() method

params.subscribe()  method  is used to  subscribe for the   route parameters

here   unsubscribe() is a   method of   Subscription object used to  unsubscribe the  data
Subscription  is  a  rxjs  object


programmatic  routing?
Using  Router's  navgate  method


home    about
home
i am   home  component

about
home      itemone        itemtwo

about home   item id: 1   item id: 2



angular  life cycle  hooks
when an anugular  application  starts  it creates and renders the  root component
(app.component.ts)   then  it creates and renders it's children and  their  children
It is  basically a tree of components


3    life cycle  methods of angular

ngOninit
when the  angular  initilizes the  compoenent for the  first  time
onNgChanges
when the  component  i/p property changes angular invokes
ngOnDestroy
if the component is destroyed   angular invokes   ngOnDestroy

fires  upon   components removal from the  view

Here  is a  Complete list of Life Cycle Hooks
1)  ngOnChanges
2)  ngOnInit
3)  ngDoCheck
4)  ngAfterContentInit
5)ngAfterContentChecked
6)ngAfterViewInit
7)  ngAfterViewChecked
8) ngOnDestroy


working with HttpClientModule  in anguar

u can  develop  the  rest  applications  using angular
REST : means  representation  state  transffer  application
in this   url is  a  resource
each api's  url is  processeed throgh get post put delete  methods

means  u can  call  API and  process API url's  using
get  post  put delete  methods
trough   Angular's   HttpClientModule
this  module  supports Object called
HttpClient
Eg import {HttpClient} from '@angular/common/http';
it has  follwing methods
  
get(url)   uesed  retrieve  data   dynamically
post(url, data, messagefromat)  used to   create resource   dynamically   
put(url, id,  updatabledate)  used to update  resources  w.r.t id dynamically
delete(url , id)   used to   delete   resource  w.r.t id  dynamically

all these  4 methods   retrns  Observable   API
It is  rxjs  API 
it  generates  unlimited  amout of data   at a perticular interval of time
it provides  lots  of methods  to subscribe for the  Obs
ervable data
one  such method is   
subscribe()  subscribes  for   response  returned from
http methods



in  imports  array  u need to import httpclientmodule


json is   a  message  format  which  uses  key and  value  both as a String


install  the  json   server
npm install  -g  json-server

used to  create  fake rest  API


assignments

create   3  componets
home  component
department compoent
and  designation compoennt

default  display home  componet  welcome  to homepage
when u click on dept component  displays  list of  departmnets
1  it
2  finance
3    hr
4   sales
5    production
6    sales

when u click on des  
it must display  list of  designations

1  engineer
2 manager
3    executive
4 analyst
5   sr manager
6  sr  executive
7    sr engineer

use  routing  for above

2)create  a fake rest API
EMP with  name, city and  age
using json server

write  angular  program  to create  text field to enter name
when  i click the  submit button w.r.t.name   i must get  city and age  of that employee


write  angular  program  to create 3 text field to enter name,city and age
when  i click the  insert button it must  be inserted   and  displayed





throgh  this  module  u can  integrate   angular with spring/spring boot
& node  js
