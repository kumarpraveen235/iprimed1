Limiting   query Results

Sorting and  Pagination   using Spring Data Jpa


U can achieve  it by using   PagingAndSorting Repository


this  interface  provides   extra method called
Iterable findAll(Sort s)

where  Sort is  a  class   present  in
org.springframework.data.domain.Sort pkg



List the emp of HR department  where  each page contains   2 records 
U can achieve  it by using   PagingAndSorting Repository


this  interface  provides   extra method called
Iterable findAll(Pagaeble p)

where Pagaeble  is a  class present in
org.springframework.data.domain.* pkg  used to achive  pagination



Spring  MVC
MVC   mean    model   view   controller
It is a  design  pattern
M  represents   Model   contains   business logic  it can  be  controller
java bean   e.t.c
V means   View   contains   presentaion logic   it can be  jsp   thymeleaf
freemarker velocity tiles
C means   Controoller    in  spring we have   built in  controller
called  FrontController by the name   DispatcherServlet
used  intecept the  request from  the   webserver


Spring  MVC  is  a light weight  framework  based  on   MVC  used
to develop   web / enterprise   / internet  applications

advantages
Saperate Roles
Light   weight
Powerful configuration
it provides   couple  of xml files  
web.xml  in this  u can  configure FrontController  Dispatcher servlet and
  spring-servlet.xml
in this   you can configure     ViewResolvers  DataSource, static   documents
Transaction  Components   Hibernate  Properties  Mapping Files   e.t.c

Rapid development
Reusable  business code

easy to test
Flexible Mapping
Spring MVC provides  lots  of annotation which makes the  flexible mapping
Eg  @RequestMapping("/getEmployees")
decalartive approach  & programmatic approach also


Architecture   of Spring MVC

1)   user types   request  on browser  and  hits  enter
broweser   generates  http request  and  goes to webserver
2) webserver receives the request  and checks  the  url pattern of request
and   also checks   web.xml 
3) if  web.xml  contains  Front Controller  entry  DispatcherServlet  means
it usnderstands  it is  MVC request and web server   hand over  the request to  Dispatcher
Servlet
DispatcherServlet is present in org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet
pkg
4)DispatcherServlet  checks   spring-servlet  config file and  and gets RequestMapping url
through  Controller name . and  varifies  this request mapping url is  same  one
which is appeared  in  mvc request. If both are  same  then DispatcherServlet
executes  Controller code  (contains  buss logic)  and generates  Model and View Object
(response) to DispatcherServet

5)DispatcherServlet gets the name of view Resolver  from  spring-servlet.xml file
and maps the  response to view like  jsp thymeleaf
6)finally   view  is generated   dynamically to client through browser


Like  Spring  core  Spring Mvc also  provides  lot of  annotations


@Controller
it is  a  steroetype  annotation
it is  a  class level annottaion
any class  annotated  with  this  annotation automatically registered  by
ApplicationContext IOC.   For  this  IOC container   scans the  package
rather than configuring this class in xml file
THtough  <context:component-scan base-pacakges=""/>

@RequestMapping("/urlpattern")
it is a  class level & method level annotation
specifies  by  what  url pattern request  is  mapped to which controller?
it is present in
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping pkg

write  spring mvc  program to  dsiplay  HelloWorld

we are using jsp  file
we write  jsp logic using JSTL (java standered  tag  libaries)

we need configure  JSTL jar
in XML file   u need to enable   MVC  annotations through
<mvc:annotation-driven/> tag



Spring MVC  uses
for  this u need to import   mvc   xml  name space  


Spring MVC  uses   different ViewResolver classes  to resole the  views
Popular  one is   InternalResourceViewResolver
it  resolves  Jsp JSTL views
it resolves the   views  by  following technique
it has  2 properties
prefix   identify the  location of the  view
suffix  indentify the   technology of view
it  must be configured in   spring-servlet.xml


multiple request mapping

multiple controller

to  create   web app  maven   project   follow  these steps
1)  create    a new  work space and  configure web server
2) create   maven web app  project  using  web app   plugin
3) configure web server  in the project
4) create   java folder  by right clicking main folder


Spring  MVC provides   an interface  called  Model
used  hold  entire web application data
Data  is  stored  in Model  interface through Strings   Maps  Objects
Collection  e.t.c
it is present in org.springframework.ui pkg
methods
void addAttribute(String attributename  String objectname)
void addAllAttribute(Coolection c)
void addAllAttrribute(Map m)


@RequestParam
it is  field level annotataion   used to bind the 
jsp/view   form field  values  to the   controller  method  parameters


create   a program  to design  login form  which contains username and password
if  both are  iprimed  then  display   successfully logged in
else   login credential are  invalid



how  to display images  in  Spring MVC?
1)  create  resources   folder  in  wepapp folder
2) crate  images   css     js  folders  in  resources   folder and 
store   documents  in that
3) configure   resources folder   using
<mvc:resources> tag in spring-servlet.xml
4) import the  corrosponding document in  ralated jsp    using EL  

Creating forms  using spring tags
spring provides   lots  of tags
they  are  basic  tags  form tags   e.t.c
form tags are  imported  using
    <%@ taglib uri="http://www.springframework.org/tags/form" prefix="form" %>
Some  of the  Form tags are
<form:form>
<form:input>
<form:checkbox>
<form:radiobutton>
<form:button>
<form:errors>
<form:hidden>
<form:password>


@ModelAttribute
it is  a  field  level attribute
it is used  to bind the 
jsp/view   form field  values  to the   controller  method  parameters(Model class
Object) through    POJO class/ model class

present  in
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ModelAttribute pkg  

create  a  class  called   Employee
with  name    age  languages  gender profession dob 
and enter   from   jsp  form  and display  through Spring MVC application
use  spring form  tags to design the  form



Spring MVC validation

spring mvc  uses   HibernateValidator   for  validation 
u can  achieve  validation in spring using javax.validator  api
which is  implemented by   HibernateValidator

javax.validation.contraints  provides  lots  of annotations
these are all  field level annotations

@Size   tot no of characters  must be entered
@Max     applied to   numeric  what is max value
@Min    applied to   numeric  what is min value
@Past   applied to   date   which is enetered < than  today date
@Future  applied to   date   which is enetered > than  today date
@Pattern    for  pattern matching
@NotNull   value must  be  eneterd
@NotEmpty  value  must be entered


SpringFramework also provide  an  interface  called
BindingResult used  check the  validation errors
it has a  method called
boolean  hasErrors()

Another annottaion is
@Valid  annotation   it is  a field level annotation
used apply validation for   Model class
it is present in javax.validation.* pkg

for  this  we  need to configure hibernate  validator   dependency



create  a  class called user  with id, name   age  city
enter from jsp   and click  submit
then  it must be inserted into mysql and  dispalyed in web page  through table
use  JdbcTemplate


1)develop MVC application   with   out xml file  using java  based configuration
Hint
use @EnableWebMvc  annotation


2) apply  validation  for  the   Spring MVC JDBC example

install  POSTMAN
