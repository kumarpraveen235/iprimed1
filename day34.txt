we can also   write spring programs  with  out xml  file
If  we write  spring programs  with out xml file  it is  called
ZERO CONFIGURATION APPROACH / PROGRAMMATIC  APPROACH/  JAVA  ANNOTATED  CONFIGURATION

@Bean
it is  a  method level annotation
when u annotate  method  with @Bean  annotation
then   it is  equivelent to  <bean  id=""   class="" />
tag in xml
used to  configure the bean  programmatically
present in
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;


@Configuration

it is a  class level  annotation
when u annotate class  with above annotation
then  no need of  xml file  It treats  it as   configuration file
in this   u can configure  0 or more  methods  with @Bean  annotation
present in

import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
@ComponentScan(pkgname)
it is   a  class level annotation  when there  is  no xml  is used
then  we use  this  annotation  to scan the packages  for  the classes
annotated  with stereo type annotation
it  is  equivelent  to
<context:component-scan base-package="com.iprimed.fsd.training.*"> in xml
it in

import org.springframework.context.annotation.ComponentScan;


This  annotation   will be  used  only  when
we  use  stereo type  annotations

To load  the   Configuration file  we use

AnnotationConfigApplcationContext class  IOC container used to load the configuration file
USED IN  java configuration (no xml file) approach
Constructor
AnnotationConfigApplcationContext(Class configclass)
AnnotationConfigApplcationContext()
methods

Object  getBean(String beanname)
Object   getBean(Class pojoclasS)
used to INSTANTIATE THE  BEAN


it is present in
org.springframework.context.annotation.AnnotationConfigApplicationContext;

create   a  class called  Product with   id name  and price
and insert   5 objects  in the List and  display  
use java  configuration


create   a  class called  Book  with   id name  and price
and insert   5 objects  in the List and  display  
use java  configuration and  sort   on price  use  Stereo Type annoattions

create   a  Prototype  scoped  Bean to display   welcome  to  spring and
instantiate  using  IOC container  and display  use   java  based  configuraton


create  a  class  called  person with  id name  and  des
inject   few objects  in Map  and  perform  following operations
insert the     person
retrieve the  person w.r.t. id
search the person by name
delete the person by id
display  all  persons
