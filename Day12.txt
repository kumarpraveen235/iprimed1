Set  interface
it   supports   unique elements
2 interfaces

Set interface   SortedSet interface


methods  of Set  interface
the methods  are  same  as   List interface  only

we  don't has following  methods
Object  remove(index i)
ListIterator listIterator()
but we have  foll method
Object  remove(Object o)

HashSet  class
it implements  Set  interface
it uses  Hashing Technique  to store the  values
hashing  technique   hash  function to cacculate the address
This   address  is used as an  index  to store  values

supports unique elements  null  elements  generic/non generic elements
o/p  any order

constructor
HashSet()
HashSet(Collection c)
HashSet(int size)

create a  class called  Student  with id name and age
Create   2  object   of Students  with  identical value
and store in  HashSet


hashcode()  : it is  a  method of  Object class
it represents the  intger value  for  object
when the object is created   the java compiler provides the  hash code for each object

note:  hashcode is not generated  for primitive  data types
Syntax
public  int hashCode()
{}


public boolean equals(Object o)


it is  also a method of Object class
compares the 2 references of  objects
if  2 objects hashCodes are  equal  then   the 2 objects/ 2 obj ref id are also  equal

in the   above hashset  program   compiler uses   default hashcode & equals method
since  2 objects are  created    using  new key word
they stored in heap area. if those  2 objects  are  same  values since  they
uses new key word  they stored in diff heap area  their references are  different
& hashcodes are also  different

to solve  this problem we need to override
hashCode & equals()  method

LinkedHashSet  class
it implements  Set  interface
it uses  Hashing uses Technique  to store the  values
hashing  technique   hash  function to cacculate the address
This   address  is used as an  index  to store  values

supports unique elements  null  elements  generic/non generic elements
o/p  is insertion  order

constructor
LinkedHashSet()
LinkedHashSet(Collection c)
LinkedHashSet(int size)

SortedSet   interface
it extends   Set interface
it o/p the  result in ascending order
it has  some  extra methods

SortedSet  headSet(Object   from)
SortedSet  tailSet(Object   to)
SortedSet  subSet(Object   from, Object to)

TreeSet  class implements  SortedSet  interface
TreeSet  stored the  data in Hierachical  structure
Stores  Large no of data
since o/p is ascending order  u can access the data fast
TreeSet  support  unique  elements, generic elements  non null elements
o/p  is ascending order

constructor
TreeSet()
TreeSet(int size)
TreeSet(Collection c)
TreeSet(Comparator c)


w.ap  to  enter   10  integers  in HashSet and  sort it

create  a Class called  Product  with  id name and price
insert  3 objects of Product in TreeSet and  Display

create  a  class called  Book with id name  author and  price
insert  5 objects  in HashSet and  sort on author and price

Map interface

it stores the data  in key value  pair
key must be unique (left)   value  can be duplicated(right)
Eg   Emp  id as  key   name as  a value
     Stud name as a key   marks as a value

methods
public   Map put(Object  key, Object value) inserts   1  row  into map
Map putAll(Map m)  adds   elements  of 1 map  to other
Set   entrySet()  returns   key value  pair of map
Set   keySet()   returns only keys
void  remove(Object key)  removes keys
Object  get(Object  key)  returns  value for key
boolean  containsKey(Object  key)  checks  key is present in map or not
boolean containsValue(Object value) checks  value is present in map or not
Collection   values()  returns only values

HashMap

it implements  Map  interface
it uses  Hashing Technique  to store the keys
hashing  technique  uses hash  function to calculate the address
This   address  is used as an  index  to store  keys

supports  1 null key   multiple null values
keys and  values  both  can be  generic and  non generic
key  must be unique  value can be dupicated
o/p is any order on key basis

constructor
HashMap()
HashMap(Map m)
HashMap(int size)

LinkedHashMap

it implements  Map  interface
it uses  Hashing Technique  to store the keys
hashing  technique  uses hash  function to calculate the address
This   address  is used as an  index  to store  keys

supports  1 null key   multiple null values
keys and  values  both  can be  generic and  non generic
key  must be unique  value can be dupicated
o/p is insertion order on key basis

constructor
LinkedHashMap()
LinkedHashMap(Map m)
LinkedHashMap(int size)

Iterating elements  of Map?
using  keySet() & get()  method




create  a  class called  Student with  name and  city
Create  a class called   Course  with  cname and  semister
insert  3  object  of  Student  as  KEY  and
insert  3  object  of  Course as  VALUE in  HashMap
and  display

o/p must be

SortedMap   interface
it extends   Map interface
it o/p the  result in ascending order  on key basis
it has  some  extra methods

SortedMap  headMap(Object   from)
SortedMap  tailMap(Object   to)
SortedMap  subMap(Object   from, Object to)

TreeMap  class implements  SortedMap  interface
TreeMap  stores the  data in Hierachical  structure
Stores  Large no of dataas a key value pair
since o/p is ascending order on key baiss  u can access the data fast
TreeMap   does not supports  NULL key, non generic  keys
but in TreeMap  value  can be  null, generic, non generic
key must be non null  and generic
o/p  is ascending order  on key basis
key must be unique  and value can be duplicated
constructor
TreeMap()
TreeMap(int size)
TreeMap(Collection c)
TreeMap(Comparator c)


create  a   class called person   with  name and  age
create  a  class  called adress with   state and city
insert  3  object  of  person as  KEY  and
insert  3  object  of  adress as  VALUE in  a TreeMap
and  display w.r.t  to   name  in ascending order

in  Map  interface  don't  sort on user  defined class  fields  stored as value

in  Map  interface  ALWAYS sort on user  defined class  fields  stored as key

create a  class called Student  with  name and  standered 
create a class called  Subject  with  sname and marks
insert  3  object  of  Student as  KEY  and
insert  3  object  of  Subject as  VALUE in  a HashMap
and sort  on  student name and student standered  wise and display 

Legacy  class in Map  interface
Hashtable Properties
both classes  implements  Map  interface

both  does not support null  key and  null value
in  both classes o/p  is   any  order  on key basis
both classes  used to store  database   configuration
in Hashtable   key and  value  can be generic and  non generic
but in
Properties key and value  must be non generic

Contsructor

Properties()
Hashtable()
Hashtable(int size)

Both classes are  Synchronized contains Extra  methods

methods  of  Properties  class
void load(InputStream  i) loads  the  properties file
String getProperties(String s)
returns  value  for Key



1) write  a  program to enter 10  elements in HashMap
where  key and  value  both  must be String
Display  only  values in a sorted Order
2) Write  a  program  to enter 7 elements  in Vector and  Convert into Stack
3) Create  a class called   Employee  with  id, name  des and salary
Insert   5 Objects of Employee  In TreeSet and  Sort on des in desc  order
and sort  on sal in asc  order
4)  Create  a class called   Employee  with   name  and des
 Create  a class called   Department  with   dname  and city
Insert   3 Objects of Employee  as a Key and
Insert   3 Objects of Department  as a Value in  TreeMap and
Sort on des  and Display

5)create   Your own Generic  Class called  First  which  sets  one  value as a Integer
and Display

O/P First<Integer>  f=new First<Integer>();
       f.setNumber(10);
    System.out.println(f.getNumber());
