Garbage  collection
in  java    no need   to destroy  the  Objects  manually
to   destoy the use less  / unreferenced objects   or to recollect the  memory
of unreferenced  objects       just   we need to issue   gc() method from System class
or Runtime class. Then  garbage  collector  back ground(daemon thread) automatically
destroy/re collect the  memory of un referned objects

This  makes java program  more ROBUST


What is  grabage?
if  created  object  don't have a reference  then  it is   a garbage or  waste
object

such objects wastes  lots of memory  we need to recollect the  memory of such
objects  by using  System.gc() method


How  to unreference the  object

or  how  make object  eligible  for  gc?

4 ways
1) nullyfying object
2) assigning reference of 1 object to other
3) anonymous  object creation
4)creating  objects  in methods 



1)   
class A
{

    void m(){}
}
public  static  void main(String [] args)
{
      A  aa=new A();
         A  aa1=new A();
     aa=null;    1 object eligible for  gc
    aa1=null;    2 object eligible for  gc
      }
}

if u try  to access  m() from aa / aa1  u will get NullPointerException



2)
class A
{

    void m(){}
}
public  static  void main(String [] args)
{
      A  aa=new A();
         A  aa1=new A();

   aa=aa1;//   aa1's refernece id is assigned to aa   So  aa is eligible  for gc
}
}

how  to recollect the  memory of   unreferenced Objects?
to achieve the  garbage collection  we need to  reqeust to JVM   by  calling   gc() method

gc()  method  is present in 2  places
1)   System.gc()
  public static void gc()

2) Using  Runtime  class

Runtime  r=Runtime.getRuntime();//  factory  method of creating an Object
   r.gc();


finalize() method
Syntax
public  void  finalize()  thows Throwable

it is a  method of  Object class
this  method is called  by   gc() method   before destroying the  Object
in this  method  u can  write the  code  related to the   objects   before  u can  destroy the  
object 
eg if the  object  contains  any connections, files  sockets  then
u can close all these in the  finalize() method
then  gc() method call finalize()  method before  destroying

Note: gc() method calls  that class's finalize() method before  destroying the Object



Data base  Fundamentals  and  
SQL programming  using MYsql  8


introduction to DBMS
it is  s/w  used   manage the  database
i.e used  to insert /delete/update  /access /retrieve data from database
u can achieve it through the  different   s/w  like Oracle  Mysql  post gre  db2  e.t.c

advantages of  DBMS
3  schema architecture

internal schema  / physical schema
specifies the  how the data  is stored internally  in the  memory
how the  data is physically represented 
eg wether  data is  stored  uisng  sequnetial  access  mode / indexed sequential access mode
e.t.c
Note there  will be only 1  internal  schema  for  database
conceptual schema  / logical schema
specifies the skeleton of the  database
like attributes datatype  width  e.t.c
If the  data is related to Student  then
id, name , age, dob, sem, marks, address, e.t.c
with  type like  Integer(10), varchar(10)  e.t.c
Note there  will be only 1  logical  schema  for  database
external schema
it is  a  schema  how the  user views / sees the data
Note there  will > 1 external  schema  for  database


models  of DBMS

3 models  are  available
1) hierachical  model:
here  data is represented  in the  form  of tree structure
it supports  1 to many   relation ships
2) network  model:
here  data is represented  in the  form  of graphs
it supports  1:m m:m  m:1 1:1   relation ships
3)Realtional model
Here  data is  represented in tables(relations)
each  column is called attributes
each  column  value is called  tuple
each  row  is called  record


Introduction to RDBMS
it is  invented  by Mr F.Codd in 1970

constraints/keys
normalization
ER  diagrams


keys
primary  key
there must   be only 1 primary key per table
it's  value  must be unique,   cannot be   duplicated  cannot  be  null also
Eg   student(id, name  ,  marks)
id is  primary key

super key
super key  is  a  set of  keys  which uniquely identifies the  rows
Eg   student(id, name ,  phoneno)

super  keys are {id}  {phoneno}   {id, name}  {phoneno, name}
{id, phoneno} {id, name,phono}



u can have more than 1 super key per table

csndidate  key

minimal set of  super key is called    candidate  key
in the  above set  of super key  candidate key is  {id}


composite key
if the primary key is created by the combination  of   more than  1  column
it is called  composite key

eg   studentno+section



and
 foreign  key
it is  a  copy of a  another  table
though  this  u can establisg parent-child relationship
between tables
there  will be  more than 1  foreign  key  in a table

Eg
 emp
id(pk)name   des   
1    ajay   engg
2   anil    mgr
3    vijay  executive

dept
dno(pk)eid(fk)  dname
  1      2       IT
  2      3       HR
  3      1      Sales


in the  above table   dept is   child table
as it contains   foreign key  as    eid   refering to  emp   for   id column
so emp is parent table
in this    emp table   id col  values  must match
dept table  eid   col values
forien key values  can contain   duplicate values

Normalization 
process of structuring/  or   filtering   the  columns of the  table
to reduce the  redundancy is called  Normalization
used to eliminate  upadation  insertion and  deletion anomalies

1NF 2NF  3NF


1NF
IN this  all  column  must  contain a   single/scalar value
there   must be  not  be more than  1  column  which  contains  same  data

favplayer   table


id   name            favplayername

1     ajay        warne  ponting sachin
2    vinay        akram   ambrose  develliers
3    kiran        azar    rohit    waugh



id   name        favplayer1  favplayter2 favplayer3

1     ajay        warne       ponting    sachin
2    vinay        akram      ambrose    develliers
3    kiran        azar         rohit    waugh

above  one is alos  not in  1st NF

split the table

person
id (pk)  name
 1     ajay
 2     vinay
 3     kiran

palyer table

id(fk)  player
 1        wr
 1       pon
 1       sach
 2       akr
 2       ambr
 2       devil
 3         azar 
 3         rohi
 3        waug


2nd NF
table must be in a  1st NF
NON  key column  must  entirely depend on  primary key

product table

prodname      price    suppliername   supplieraddress

primarykey(prodname, suppliername) // composite primary key

in the  above  table  non key col  supplieraddress  not entirely depenedent on
primary  key(prodname and suppliername)
as if i know  onlu suppliername  i will  getsupplier address
so it is not in 2nd NF

Split the table


product table    primarykey(prodname, suppliername) 

prodname      price    suppliername 

supplier table

suppliername(fk)     supplieraddress


3rd  NF

table  must be  in 2nd NF
and also   there  must be  no  transitive  depenedency
i.e. non key column must  not depend on another  non key column


person

adhaarno(Pk)   pname    dob    street  city    zipcode
 
split the  table

person   child table
adhaarno (pk)  pname    dob   zipcode(fk)
111	        a       xxx    222	
	
address   parent  table
 
   zipcode(pk)  street  city
      222          x      y

ER Diagrams
Entity Relationship Diagrams

Entity
it is  a  name  of a person / thing/ place/object
entity is represented  in  rectangle

each entity has a characteritic called  attribute
represented in oval

relationship is represented by  rombhus

any  entity  does not have  primaty key it is called  weak  entity
represented  by double  rectangle

eg   instalment  (amt, date)
     payment  (amt, date)
relationship  between  such  entities are called  weak  relationships
represented by double line rombhus



SQL  programming  using MYSQL 8


BJY6/ju(Tvo0


Storage   engines  in mysql

contains the  data  of the  mysql  stores the  entire data  of mysql

MyISAM
It  extends  old  ISAM storage  engine
MyISAM tables are optimized    for compression and speed
MyISAM tables are more portable between  os
size is upto 256 TB
These are not transaction safe
before  mysql 5.5 it was  default storage engine

InnoDB
This  engine tables are  ACID  complient
and supports transactions
speed  in performance
supports  foreign keys rollbacks   commits  e.t.c
these can store upto 64TB
InnoDB  tables are more portable between  os
MERGE
it is a virtual table
COMBINES multiple   MyISAM tables
improve the performance by joining tables

MEMORY

these  uses  hash indexes to improve the  performance faster than  MyISAM
stored in  memory

data types  of mysql
boolean     it  internally  uses  tinyint
char  it can hold up to 20 characters
date   uses    yyyy-mm-dd  format
datetime   uses   yyyy-mm-dd 00:00:00
decimal(p,s)   p-->length    s->no of  fractional digits
decimal(10,5)   979.97979
int    ranges from -214 crore  + 214 crore
tinyint   small int    mediumint (-83 lakh to 83lakh)    int    bigint   
time 
timestamp
varchar   up to    65535 characters   
length  will be  255  bytes

Mysql support   4 kinds of  commads
DDL   create  truncate  rename  alter  drop   


creating tables   with  all  data  types and  contraints

my sql supports 
primary key
unique
foreign key
default
not null
check




create  table  student
with   following

id  int pk
name  not null  unique  varchar
city varchar  default  noida
marks  int  >50 
dob  date


DML   update  delete  insert
 DCL   grant  revoke
 TCL   commit savepoint   rollback
