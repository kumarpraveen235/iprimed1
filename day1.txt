software:
it is   more   than just a program code
A program  is an executable  code which   serves   some computational purpose
It is   considered to be a  collection of execuatble  programming code  associated libraries  and 
documentations
S/w   when  made   for a specific   requirement  is called s/w   product

engineering
it is all about  developping products using well  defined   sceintific
principles and methods

s/w  product   development involves   following steps


requirements
system analysis
system design
code design
testing
deploymnet
maintainannce
updates



software   engineering    is an  engineering branch associated with development of s/w product
using well defined  scientific  principles   methods and  procedures.


According to IEEE
S/W  engineering   is the 
application of   a  systematic desciplined   quantifiable    approach   to the development
operation and the maintainance of the  s/w 
i.e
  application of engineering to s/w


SDLC

it is  also  called  Software  development  life cycle   is a  well defined  structured    sequence
of stages    in software engineering  to develop the   intended  s/w product

SDLC  framework involves  following steps

Communication
Requirement  gathering
Fasibility study
System analysis
S/W  design
coding
testing
integration
implementation
operations and maintainance
disposition



u  can achieve   SDLC  by using   different models

model: it is a  staergy   to develop the  s/w

it has  it's  own set of tools methods  and procedures
we can also call it as  
s/w development paradigm


waterfall model
iterative model
spiral model
v-model
big bang model

agile  model
the  meaning   of    agile is   switft or  versatile
Agile  process model  refers  to     s/w  development
approach  based on iterative development
Agile methods  break  tasks into smaller iteartions  or parts and  do not involve directly
into  long term planning
