Install  the STS  plugin     or   install  STS    IDE

in sts  to  develop web  mvc applications  through  spring boot u need to install

jsp  plugin   eclipse   enterprise  java and web developer tools

what is  spring boot?
  it is  a spring module     that privides    the RAD
(rapid application development)    feature  to spring framework
it is  built on top of spring framework
it provides easier and faster way to   set up configure   and run  all
kinds of  applications  (console, web mvc , web -REST)

Spring boot=spring framework+embedded web server(jetty/tomcat)-  xml file


reasons  for   useing spring boot
spring boot uses  Depenedency injection
it contains powerfull   database transaction   management capabilities
it simplifies integration    with    other  java frameworks  like
JPA  Hibernate   ORM struts  junit mockito
reduces   the  cost and development time as  everything in spring boot
is AUTO CONFIGURED


ADVANTAGES
creates   stand alone application
u can develop   web mvc & web REST application
provides  starter   POMs in the   maven's POM .xml
i.e   no need to specify version of  jar it downloads the  correct version of depenedency 
according to the version of  spring boot. This  is  ingerited in the  starter
parent in pom
provides  production ready features  like  matrix, health     actuators
u can also configure the properties   externally
no xml   configuration
provides  CLI  to  to develop and  test applications
supports  lots  of plug ins
minimized  boiler plate  code
increases the  productivity


Goals   of spring boot
provides the     opionionated   development appraoch
avoids  defining more annotated  configuration
avoids  writing lots of import statements
avoids    xml configuration




pre requisite  for   spring boot
u must have  jdk 1.8
u must have  a  build tool like  maven 3.0+ / gradle
sts plugin  or  STS ide
spring framework 5.0


Spring boot  features
web developement
console application
supports  events   and listeners
supports  adminstration features
externalized configurations
supports  properties  file
supports  YAML configuration
type  safe configuration
logging
security


curret version is  2.7

architecture of spring boot
it suites  for  Layered  architecture



	<parent>
		<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
		<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
		<version>2.6.9</version>
		<relativePath/> <!-- lookup parent from repository -->
	</parent>

above  element in   pom.xml  sets the  version of   jar file
w.r.t  the  version  of  spring  boot
no need of  version  tag  for  spring boot starter  depenedencies


spring boot  provides   starter depenedencies
like
for  web   spring-boot-starter-web  configures  tomcat server  jackson depenedencies
    jdbc  spring-boot-starter-jdbc  configures   jdbc tx  
   validation  spring-boot-starter-validation     configures   hibernate validator
   thymeleaf  spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf    configures  thymeleaf view
   datajpa  spring-boot-starter-jpa    configures spring data jpa

Spring  boot is    used for  Auto configuration   

Autoconfiguration  means    FrontController  Dispatcher Sevlet
for  MVC/REST application   automatically configured in the application 
when u use   web dependency 
no need specify it's name  in  web.xml

Tomcat server   automatically  configured  in web application
when u use   web dependency    how ever u can change it's port 
in properties file  through server.port


Jackson Data  bind   depenedency    which converts  java type  to jason
types   automatically gets  configured
when u use   web dependency 

when u use   spring data jpa / jdbc depenedncy  application  will not start
as  Spring boot internally uses in memory H2 database
u need to set the  url of   H2 DATABASE
else  u need  to set   URL of   respected database  in properties  file
when u set driver class  name  url username  password of respective
database  then  DATASOURCE  AUOMATICALLY gets  configured
no need to configure it in spring-servlet.xml through  DriverManagerDataSource


when  you are   serving with   views  like   jsp/ thyme leaf

configure  the  jsp in properties  file through   spring.mvc.view.prefix/suffix
then automatically   jsp  gets configured  no need  to configure
in  spring-servlet.xml  through InternalResourceViewResolver


hibernate  properties  like   hbm2ddl.auto  show sql   dialect properties
are also  automatically configured in properties  file
when u configured   spring data jpa  depenedency in pom.xml
no need to configure LocalSessionFactoryBean in spring-servlet.xml


who will   do auto configuration

Entry point for  SpringBoot application  program is
DemoApplication class
This  class is annotated with   @SpringBootApplication annotation
this  annotation  does  the  AutoConfiguration

@SpringBootApplication=@EnableAutoConfiguration+@ComponentScan

@EnableAutoConfiguration  it is  similiar to @Configuration
it configures and wires beans    based  on bean  methods
it also configures  extra things like   configuring tomcat server
configures  helper classes  configure   jar depenedencies

it is present in 
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.EnableAutoConfiguration;




@ComponentScan  will  scan th package for   classes   annotated  with
stereotype  annoattions

SpringApplication class

it has  lots  of methods

like  to   show off the banner 
void setBannerMode(Banner.Mode.OFF)

to customize application start  up

void  run(args)


to turn of   startup info logs
void   setLogsStartupInfo(boolean flag)


SpringApplication  s=new Stringapplication(MainClass c)
constructor for  SpringApplication
SpringApplication(Class c)
it is  present in import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;






when u use   spring data jpa / jdbc depenedncy  application  will not start
as  Spring boot internally uses in memory H2 database
u need to set the  url of   H2 DATABASE
else  u need  to set   URL of   respected database  in properties  file
when u set driver class  name  url username  password of respective
database  then  DATASOURCE  AUOMATICALLY gets  configured
no need to configure it in spring-servlet.xml through  DriverManagerDataSource


perform the   CRUD  operations  in Mysql uisng  Jdbc Template
in SpringBoot console application


perform the   CRUD  operations  in Mysql uisng  Spring Data  Jpa
in SpringBoot console application



For this  u need to implement  CommandLineRunner interface
in  Main  program and override  run() method
In this  run() method  u need to invoke data  access logic

developping  web application/ serving   JSP /html   in   spring boot

following are  the   steps
1)create  the     spring boot project and  change  packaging  to  war
instead  of jar. This  create  webapp  folder  in  main
and  adds   tomcat dependency  in  pom.xml
if   u have  not changed the  packaging from jar  to war
then  u need  to  manually create   webapp folder
2)manually create   WEB-INF/jsp  folder in webapp  folder
3) spring boot by default  uses  thymeleaf views
to use  jsp  view  we need jsp compiler and  jstl view also

so add  tomcat-embed-jasper  dependecy in pom.xml
it is  a jsp  compiler  compiles  jsp page
and also  add  jstl  depenedency in pom.xml

4) configure   jsp  in properties  file
with   spring.mvc.view.prefix & suffix

5)annotate  Controller  with  @Controller  annotation
instead  of @RestController


create a class  called  product   with  id  name and  price
insert  5 objects   in the   List and  display  in a Table
through jsp  in  springboot
Design table  with bootstrap


create  a  class  called   Emp   with  id name and city   dob
insert into   emp table  using   datajpa   with  validation and  display
trough  jsp
