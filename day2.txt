history   of java

java   was  invented  by  3  scientists  called
green team    named  mike   sheredon  patrik naughton  and james ghousling


invention of   java was  started in 1995 
initilly used  for   developping set top boxes
in  early   1996   beta and alpha  versions  of  java are released

java is  not an acronym
it is  a  ISLAND of  indonasia  where  1st coffeee  plant  was produced

applications  of  java  
used  to develop  console  based  applications
used  to develop web applications  like   tutorial  sites,   college   web sites

used to develop  enterprise  applications like
banking/railway reservation/ shopping cart  applications  e.t.c
rest   applications
ued  in development of  smart cards
desk top applications  like  anti  virus  acrobat reader
development of games
used  to develop   mobile based applications  
used in robotics


different  forms   of  application   we  can develop in java

1)  console  based  application  where   programs  are executed  through main  method
J2SE

2)   web applications   where  programs are  executed  through   web server
involves  html css  java script  ajax   jquery  servlet  jsp   spring mvc struts
J2EE

3)   enter prise  applications
involves    spring   web mvc     application server
EJB  JMS e.t.c
J2EE
4)   j2me  application  used  in  mobile  developent
J2ME

5)  JAVAFx   used develop rich internet  applications


Characterstics  of Java

simple
java  does not supports   pointers  operator  overloading
structures  unions    multiple inheritance at  class level makes  java programming
more simple
object oriented
java  supports   object   oriented  programming
like   abstraction:  hides  implementation  details and   shows  only  functionality
in java  u  can achieve it using abstract class & interface
inheritance:
if one  object   aquires  properties and  behaviour  of parent  object
it is called  INHERITANCE  it is  IS-A reatltion ship  achieved by extends and  implements
key words
eg:  class  Vahicle{}   class  Byke  extends  Vahicle{}

  encapsulation
   binding the  data   and code together   which  keeps  safe from interfference and
outside world   
Eg  java class  / java bean     capsule  medicine


 polymorphsim 
one interface/entity  is used   to perform  different / many forms  of  actions
in java   polymorphism   is  achieved by   Method overloading/ overriding   
and 
 aggregation

it is a  form  of association
if one  class  reference is specified  in another class it is called(dependent  class)
aggregation

class   Address
{
   int streetno;
String city, state;
}
class Emp
   {
   int id;
String name;
  Address  addr;// aggregation
}


plat form independent
ability to execute the  java  program   in different plat forms/ different os  is
called  plat form  independent
to generate   a  executable   code   from java    it requires  2 steps
1)  compilation  using  javac   when u compile the  java program  using javac u will
get class file called  BYTE code
javac  filename.java
2)  interpreting   :  done by  JVM  (java vertual  machine)
JVM interprets   byte code into executable  code
java  filename

ie.   u can write   java  program  and  compile  it in one os

and   execute it in another  os      with  out recompiling
this  feature is called  platform independent

note   java  is  a  platform  independent
but JVM is not a plat  form  indepenedent
because diff os  have  diff   versions  of JVM but all  JVM interprets  same  byte code





portable
ability the  carry the   byte code  of  java  program  into differet plat forms
and  execute  successfullly  with out recompiling is called
portable

architecture neutral
java   behaves    same   in  different   os/  os  architecture
it's features are  static they  will not change

Eg  in java   int datatype   always takes  width of  4  bytes  in 32/64  os
in c    int datatype  take width of  2 bytes in 32 bit os & 4 bytes in 64 bit os  

secure
java  programs  are more secure as  they   does not support pointers
since   java has  it's  own environment called  JRE
while  compiling   java  does  not interacts  with  os
this  eliminates   the  effecting  the  programs present  in os with  java
so java is more secure

robust 
robust  means  STRONG
Exception  handling  feature and  automatic  garbage  collection feature
makes   java programming more ROBUST


multithreaded
A thread  is a  part of  a  program
in java   u can  execute  multiple  threads   symultaniously
improves the  performance of the application
eg: in one  program  1  thread  write   set of  no to file
other  thread  reads the  no from the file

high performance  &  interpreted

java   is   compiled +   interpreted  language

as  java  program  compiled  into byte code   by javac
byte  code is   interpreted by JVM to generate  executable  code

this  slows  the  performance

to improve the  performance   JVM  uses   JIT (just  in time) compiler
it   converts  piece by piece   byte  code  into  executable  code(no waiting time)

instead  of  whole  byte code  gets converted into executable code (creates  waiting time)


dynamic
java   programs  especially  inheritance  programs   generates   lot of

dynamic  information /   generates  info  at run time
in these  type of object   known  at  run time  called   late  binding
Eg
class A
{}
class B extends A
{
     main............
{
   
B bb=new B()
}}

here   bb is  a object  of class B also  & class A also
it  is decided at  RUN TIME  BY JVM


servlet  / jsps/ spring  mvc  generates  dynamic  web pages


distributed
U can access  the   objects/ APPLICATION/ program  from   multiple   JVM'S
DISTRIBUTED ACROSS network
eg : RMI  application/     banking application   by EJB

strongly typed

int   i=10;
byte  b=(byte)i; 

in java   all    variables   expressions   assignments
are   stricly have types  
if any mis match  occurs   generates   compile  time error

typemismatch

that  is  why  java is strongly  typed  language
